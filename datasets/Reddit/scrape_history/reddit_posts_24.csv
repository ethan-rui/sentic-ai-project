Hey everyone,

So I just recently got into the stock market and had a weird occurrence when I first started talking to people about stocks. 

This all started because I lost my job during the pandemic, had no way to make money and was struggling to pay my rent. I started with small trades, $50 into Tesla, $100 into Apple, just starting with companies that I was comfortable with. 

Now, I have expanded my portfolio into almost every industry ranging from marijuana to healthcare. But I am struggling with one thing, the woman. I was told that if I wore a suit and went to a bar and talked about stocks, that girls would want to sleep with me. That is simply not the case for me, as I have not gotten any action since the pandemic. I am not sure if it’s because I am talking about the wrong stocks that don’t get women excited? Or if I am using the wrong terminology when discussing the market. 

I could use help because the main reason I got into the stock market was to pickup women, and yet I have managed to lose almost my whole income without getting any action. 

Any help would be appreciated as I am close to losing my house. 

Thanks.",2

20,pi1vke,2021-09-04,qu83rt,Space tendies 👨‍🚀🚀🌑🌌☄💫🛰👽👾📡🔭,"It seems to be a good time to make some tendies off space plays. Three companies (rocket lab usa [RKLB], spire [SPIR], redwire [DNPK -&gt; RDW]) have just gone public through spacs with three more soon to follow.

Over the last few days: 

* RKLB is up 35% 
* SPIR is up 30% (not counting the dip AH)
* RDW I had to pay like 12.6 for to get into AH on Friday. 

Astra (ASTR) also went public recently, but if you didn't see they recently had a failed launch and are yet to have a successful launch. I lost over 5k from that, I suggest avoiding them like the plague, maybe buy in straight after their first successful launch if/when that ever happens as the price will probably climb then (who knows how many failures they will have before then and consequently how low the share price will dip). 

Let's also not forget the WSB darling ast space mobile (ASTS) which has climbed over 50% from the low $8s, damn I wish I had known about it then! 

The three companies going public soon are:

* blacksky (SFTW -&gt; BKSY) (vote for merger is on 8th September 10am ET)
* planet (DMYQ-&gt; PL) (by EOY 2021)
* satellogic (CFV -&gt; SATL) (early q4 2021)

From what I can tell (please correct me if there's more info out) the last two are guaranteed with no date set in stone, whereas the blacksky merger has a vote on the 8th September at 10am ET, I would be very surprised if they vote no!

From what I can gather RKLB is the best play and what I plan to hold the most of long term. However I would be surprised if there isn't money to be made from the rest of these plays (including ASTR but only if/when they have a successful launch). I plan to buy up big with each of BKSY, PL and SATL as they go public to try and ride the wave of each, rolling the profits from one to the next. 

**Current positions**:

* RKLB: 3950 shares @ $11.26 avg
* SPIR: 1300 shares @ $11.5 avg
* RDW: 1250 shares @ $12.6 avg

I did buy my first 1.5k RKLB shares at $10, some more at $11.1, and day traded some with another account on Friday, buying another 1k AH at $13.6. 

**Questions for the audience**:

What other space plays are people keeping an eye on? Eg. GSAT.

What companies do people see as competitors for each other? (eg. planet and satellogic) and which do you think will be the more successful?
