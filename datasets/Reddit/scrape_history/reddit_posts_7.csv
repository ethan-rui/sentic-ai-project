6,psggmf,2021-09-21,808LT,IRNT - Morning Brief,"A re-cap for this week
Just wanted to post a recap for this week.

Threshold security We are still on the threshold securities list. Today marks the 12th day. And tomorrow is T+13 which would indicate forced covering.

Going by the data on fintel from the end of August it looks as though at least 1.2 mill FTDs outstanding. But there could be more, could someone confirm in comments more knowledge on this.

I will also point out, this isn’t 100% reliable because we all know FTD covering can be combatted with corruption.

T+2 on last weeks calls Would fall on today so I do feel bullish for today.

Next ITM big strike prices $35, $40 and $80 are currently our biggest ITM strikes. With $45/$50/$60 following close behind.

Share dilution Could someone confirm in the comments regarding dilution dates. Word out is that the 27th Sep there will be some dilution, then I heard it’s not. Some confirmation would be good.

Chart patterns On the 1H chart the cup and handle formation is still very much playing out nicely. It looks as though today the breakout from the handle happens.

15,psobjt,2021-09-21,PurportedGamer,3D Mapping the Future: $MTTR dd,"Has everyone heard of the metaverse? Evil corporations have been planning and building for a future where everything happens digitally because boomers destroyed the planet and refused to admit they could create a sustainable future without dirty oil money. In order for this transition to the metaverse to occur, we have to have accurate depictions of interiors with 3D depth that you can perceive naturally. Enter Matterport. Their technology allows just that. Not only do they have a SEVERE market advantage in the real estate sector, but they have utility as an NFT company. Their goal is to digitally map real structures for you to experience from your couch. Like the matrix but without the computer overlords. 

Take some time to really navigate around these demos: 

[Lambo Dealer](https://matterport.com/gallery/lamborghini-mexico-city)

[Super Yacht](https://matterport.com/gallery/horizon-fd92-hull-19)

One of the coolest parts is that inside each of these you can interact with data points and perform actions like measurements etc. Imagine what utilities it will have in 10 years. 


It’s no coincidence they map lambo dealers, super yachts, and mansions. Their stock is going to help us all buy them.

19,psn7dm,2021-09-21,thedelusionalwriter,"With stocks doing their wild thing, I'm hopeful people might be up for another hypothetical apocalyptic stock market question?","First, I'm a writer.  So, no actual ill intentions.  But, now onto the theoretical.  A few weeks back, I posted here and some of you helped me fill in some blanks on how a single person/fund could make huge gains in a day.  Here's a link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ozuf3h/im_curious_if_anyone_can_help_me_understand_the/

I've now moved on and have been wondering about wild and true black swan events.  So my question now is: what if a company arrived who held such advanced technology that they could considerably take over any industry within a relatively short period of time?  So, what would happen to the stock market if it was ""attacked"" by essentially two forces?  The first force would be a fund so technologically advanced that it could manipulate the price of stocks to extract a reliable rate of return that could also be hedged against?  The second force would be a company that could truly wipe out any competitor due to sheer market force and technological ""magic"".  I realize that loyalty exists and that brands matter, but if a company arrived tomorrow that offers amazing internet, for $1 a month, then it would wipe out all ISPs almost overnight (just an example).  I guess this is more of a scenario than a question, but I'm just curious about what people imagine time frames would be like and how it would affect society?

You all were helpful last time, and here's an early draft of how I've put together some of these ideas so far: https://www.thomasbenedict.com/post/excerpt-from-worlds-2-initial-economic-attack 

The except in the link above is from my 2nd novel in my Worlds Series.  The story is about the discovery of consciousness as a force of nature, and while I consider it science fiction or a technothriller, it's also kind of a new category that might best be called a startup/financial thriller - if people get pumped about this kind of thing?? Here's a link to the first book if anyone cares about this realm: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094HM8NXW

Thanks, and if people are too stressed by the daily Evergrande excitement - don't worry about my story telling hopes, just go make some money.",1
