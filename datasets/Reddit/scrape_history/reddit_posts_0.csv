1,px6rin,2021-09-28,webpro360,Does anyone agree?,"For most $CLOV holders this is old news. For the newer ones, here's a review and potential preview.

Look back to the CLOV chart, I prefer candlestick type, on June 2 when CLOV advanced from 7.66 to 8.89 on 34mil shares. Next day we hit a high of 10.46 on 48mil shares. June 4 we dropped to 8.97 on 16mil shares. But, the setup for the squeeze was already in place. June 7 we hit a high of 12.00, on 125mil shares, followed up by 24.93 on June 8 on 735mil shares and 28.85 on June 9 on 371mil shares.

My point is, the days, weeks and volume leading to June's huge run were different from other cycles, and nearly identical to the last several days, weeks and volume -- with this big difference -- we have added several more positive catalysts since June:

\- Big earnings surprise in August (140% increase year-over-year revenue)

\- Two awarded patents in August (providing Clover Assistant protection it needs for licensing agreements and added revenue streams beyond CLOV's current business model)

\- Approval issued last week for 2022 expansion plans from CMS, near doubling our service area, in time for open enrollment (begins in 2-3 weeks)

\- The strong probability age for Medicare benefits will soon be lowered from 65 to 60 means a much larger pool of revenue

\- And, final, the added likelihood of analysts finally stepping forward with favorable ratings

Bottomline: At $7.80, CLOV is highly undervalued and positioned, at least on the charts, for a big move, and there's plenty of upcoming positive catalysts to support it.

Short squeeze or not, CLOV is the stock I'll continue to buy and HODL. I currently hold 7,750 shares (9.26 average cost) and a goal to accumulate 10K shares total. I'm adding weekly, and will continue to add for any amount under $30. These are all just my thoughts and opinions. Does anyone else agree?",2

4,px29hn,2021-09-28,Johnblr,Micron to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today. Can Its Earnings Fix the Stock?,"Micron (ticker: MU) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell. The consensus estimate is adjusted earnings of $2.33 a share on revenue of $8.22 billion. Micron has issued guidance for earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 a share, and revenue of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, according to FactSet. In the year-ago quarter, Micron reported an adjusted profit of $1.08 a share on revenue of $6.06 billion.

Citi Research analyst Christopher Danely expects Micron to report earnings that are in line with consensus estimates, and that executives will issue guidance that comes in below fiscal first-quarter forecasts. He‚Äôs bullish on the company, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock. But he projects the memory the company makes will get 5% to 10% cheaper in the fourth quarter, and 10% cheaper early next year. That dip is likely a short-term issue, he wrote in a note published Monday. Danely expects memory pricing to drop as much as 10% through the first quarter in 2022, and recover that 10% in the second half of next year.

As a result of lower prices for memory, Danely cut his estimates for 2022 revenue to $32.50 billion, and earnings to $8.82 a share. The consensus among analysts tracked by FactSet is for earnings of $10.87 a share for fiscal 2022 on revenue of $36.25 billion. Danely said the worst memory price drops will occur in the first three months of 2022, and the company‚Äôs gross margins will bottom out at roughly 40%. Analysts expect gross margins of 47% for the fourth quarter.

Of the analysts who cover Micron, 88% rate shares a Buy, and 13% have a Hold rating on the stock. There are no sell ratings on Micron, according to FactSet. The average target price is $110.10, which implies an upside of 47%. Shares of Micron advanced 1.5% to $75.40 in Monday trading. The stock has been flat this year, as the PHLX Semiconductor Index, or SOX, rose 23%.

But its guide for 4% sequential growth spooked investors.

Digital Turbine's business is now incredibly diversified and will print more than $1.1 billion in revenues this year.
Digital Turbine is still priced in the bargain basement at 5x forward sales.

Digital Turbine is a very exciting business to be a shareholder of. And there's no question that Digital Turbine is growing at a very fast rate. For now, this stock remains very cheaply valued at close to 5x forward sales.

This low valuation provides investors with a very large margin of safety. And given that the stock now trades near the six-month low price, I believe that this price point is worthwhile buying more at.

Go $APPS!!!

20,px5nt4,2021-09-28,nobjos,Should you invest in the most reputable brands in the world? - Benchmarking performance of the worlds most reputable brands against S&amp;P500,"Coke is just soda | Levi‚Äôs are just jeans | The iPhone is just a phone | GME is just a stock

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company‚Äôs performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let‚Äôs see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)

**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\]

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)

**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]

https://preview.redd.it/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5

 **Results** 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796

 Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year‚Äôs list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)

But, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \[5\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year‚Äôs worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cp1acpytp8q71.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79a8269e8083fdbdf4f44e9ef093ee54ee2b73c1)

**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week‚Ä¶

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] [This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&amp;ab_channel=BigThink) by Big Think showcases how Apple and Nike have spent billions of dollars for creating a positive brand image in our brains and most of us, in the end, are not rational customers.

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it‚Äôs directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&amp;P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It‚Äôs from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don‚Äôt think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it‚Äôs not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

Goldman just moderated an interview with LLNW's CEO and CFO, and I predict will very soon announce a stock upgrade and issue a new price target, likely in the $7-$10 range. The whole downgrade was solely so their trading arm could load the boat then issue new guidance, this time including the acquisition. It's total BS, but also extremely transparent and easy to take advantage of by loading up now. LLNW closed today at, believe it or not, $2.50.
