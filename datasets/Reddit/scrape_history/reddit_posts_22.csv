7,pj5bdh,2021-09-06,LineChatter,Looking to do my first options trade and trying to learn.,"I have some money in savings that I want to put to work and want to try options. It's a small enough amount that I can afford to lose. Looking to do my first options trade (under $500) to see how the system works. Not looking to retire in a week or a hail Mary, but feels like after watching videos and websites I'm ready to try a small trade to get paid in knowledge to do bigger trades in the future.

Trying to keep things really basic for now:

I think the price of company X will drop over time, so I'm going to use a put. I think it will be a slow decline, so I'm looking at puts in the future, something 60 days out. As time passes, if I'm right the value of the option should increase, then I can sell the option before 60 days on the open market.

Let's say the stock is worth $10 today. I have no idea what it will be worth in 60 days. My inclination is to do a $10 put and not try to get too fancy with guessing the future value, just that it will be lower. So that's where I'm at.

If the stock goes to $12, I lose the money that I used to buy the option. Complete loss. If the price goes to $8, I made a profit on the spread, less the cost of the put?

Something I don't get: Doesn't this transaction require someone on the other side who made a call? If there are no calls to cover all of the puts, what happens to my put? If I buy a 60-day put and decide to sell after 30, there will be buyers?

Thanks in advance.",1

11,pjczc0,2021-09-07,ShortChecker,Leaving WSB,"Alright as the title says I‚Äôm leaving WSB.

Fair well to all you retards, y‚Äôall were awesome.

Literally, just posted a post about how CLOV was probably going to be a pump and dump, the mods u/zjz commented a few times in favour of the post, in 2 hours it had 2k upvotes and good communication from both sides in the comment section ‚Ä¶ then boom! ‚Ä¶ shits removed.

Shit is fucking weird here nowadays, I might still lurk around here and there, but, I won‚Äôt be engaging in this subreddit anymore.

Shit went to shambles bro. Wish my fellow brothers and sisters the best luck on your bets!

12,pja2t1,2021-09-06,steeldeal80,Should I sell my mutual fund (VASGX) in a taxed brokerage account to move that money into my Roth 401k?,"Hi there, looking for advice as I have about $12,000 in a VASGX mutual fund in a taxed brokerage account I opened before I got a 401k through work (and before I opened a Roth IRA), but I‚Äôm wondering if I should sell it (about $3-4k in long term gains) and instead use it to contribute towards my Roth 401k‚Äôs annual contribution. I have used only about $6k of the $19.5k annual limit, but even if I don‚Äôt put more in I‚Äôll still utilize my company‚Äôs full match. 

I am thinking it would be better to have that money grow for long term in the Roth 401k rather than a taxed brokerage account, but I‚Äôve also heard selling mutual funds can be tricky for taxes. For context, I‚Äôm 25. Any thoughts?",1

17,pj4svy,2021-09-06,bmwfan24,$XL Update - Muddy Waters announces exit of their short position while markets are closed,"$XL - Looks like Muddy waters sneakily announced they have exited their short position this weekend while markets are closed. It was due to them and the non stop short attack that the stock tanked from $20s to 6s back in March. With the main bear thesis now gone, all signs point towards a return to $10+ with due to the non stop positive news releases and ~400m cash on hand. 

With this announcement there‚Äôs not much stopping it from skyrocketing on Tuesday at market open, since all of Carson block‚Äôs followers will be racing to close their short position as well.
