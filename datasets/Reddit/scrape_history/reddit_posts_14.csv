15,poah6y,2021-09-14,Veloc2,"I bought $6,000 of Nintendo this morning, read why.","1) The dip is good and the 5 yr trend is upward. $63 now, worth $80

2) I like how the CEO took a pay cut to avoid layoffs; he took the blame for WiiUs failure.

3) The Switch I thought was so stupid and un-proprietary but it's doing well.

4) Strong IP, currently Animal Crossing is doing well. 

I think within a year it'll hit 80 again then higher. OC the market may crash before then.",1

ELi5

what does Palantir do that Honeywell forge cant?

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like a bunch of companies are going to compete in this space- What is so significant about PLTR's software solution that gives them a moat?

23,poaah7,2021-09-14,MaryAustin24,Could EverQuote (EVER) use some love?,"EverQuote is a free service which matches consumers with an insurance provider. They started off with car insurance and have expanded into health, life and home. 

They were founded by a couple of guys from MIT. 

Their revenue is driven by lead generation for insurance companies. Expanding into new vertices should help bolster their revenue growth. They also have a big opportunity with generating ad revenue.  This space is growing at a much higher clip and should give them even more upside. 

Their market cap is $625M. Their full year 2021 revenue is projected to be around $445M.  
Stock has a low float, sub 20M. 

This isn’t a short squeeze candidate or anything like that. It seems to have fallen off the radar and I’m hoping it’s at the beginning of a reversal to the upside. It might be worth a look. 

This is not financial advice. 

Position: 500+ shares at an average of $24.60. Currently trading at $21.45. 

This is my first post here and I’m scared! Please don’t hurt me.",1
