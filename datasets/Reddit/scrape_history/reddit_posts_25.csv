Clover Health Investments, Corp‚Äôs (NASDAQ:CLOV) stock attempted to bust through an upper resistance level at the $9.09 mark but rejected the level and wicked from it.

The stock has attempted to break above the level on three separate occasions over the past eight trading days but failed.

Clover Health had above average volume Thursday, however, indicating interest has returned to the stock. By the afternoon, 22.11 million shares of Clover Health had traded hands compared to the average 10-day trading volume of 18.85 million.

In June, rising volume in Clover Health preceded a massive short squeeze that propelled the stock up 221% to an all-time high of $28.85 over the course of just three trading days.

The stock then plummeted almost 75% lower, where it found an Aug. 19 bottom at $7.41. Clover Health has since traded sideways but could be setting up for another epic squeeze.

Clover Health fits the bill due to its underlying statistics:

Small Float: Clover Health has a relatively small float of 198.66 million shares.
High Ownership: 74.19% of Clover Health‚Äôs float is held by insiders and institutions, with insiders owning 15.43% of available shares and institutions owning 58.76%.
Short Interest: 30.27 million, which means 15.23% of Clover Health total float is held short. This number has increased from 28.61 million in July.
On Thursday, options traders piled in and purchased $315,393 in bullish Clover Health call contracts. Most of the traders chose a strike price of $10 and a Jan. 21 expiry, but one trader paid $25,393 for 379 calls with a whopping $25 strike expiring Feb. 18.

Why It‚Äôs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.

These types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù has entered into a position.

18,phaiqs,2021-09-03,moneyshotmagelol,WISH about to explode?!,"**Hey WSB.** 

This is my first post here and more specifically on a stock that I personally dislike unlike most of you probably reading this. I have been in and out of the meme craze for a long time now, but this is one opportunity that I find too good to pass up. WISH had a huge gap down on 8/13 which has led it steadily to a daily low of 6.14 on 8/19. Here is where a new daily short-term uptrend forms. If you look at my chart: https://imgur.com/a/nj68Ovp you can clearly see WISH slowly moving towards breaking that long-term downtrend it has been stuck in since its highs @ 32.85 on 1/28. After all of these months, it has the potential to start breaking out not only on the daily chart but the weekly chart too. This could create a huge rise in the stock price in the coming weeks.

**So now you are probably wondering what should the play be right?**

If you want a safe entry I recommend looking to start a position when WISH closes above 7.9ish on a daily candle, as we can start filling the gap back to 9.35.

Now if you want a riskier entry (really not that risky) I would say right now is a great time to grab some calls with at least 2 weeks till expiration on them and ride out this short-term daily trend that we have formed. In order to hold this trend, the lowest the stock price can hit today is 7.1 and 7.2 on Tuesday (market closed Monday). Under these levels, you can cut, but I truly believe it's worth the risk now, as they move to the upside if we break that long-term trend will be explosive. 

I am in 20 of the September 24th 7.5 calls @ .50. If we can see WISH hit 8.0 on Tuesday then they will be priced @ .88, but this is only when we begin to start filling the gap. If we can see it hit our PT of 9.35 by next Friday, then the options will be priced @ 1.88 (gain of over 250%). I feel like the risk to reward is too great to pass up here, so I plan on doubling down at the close.

**TLDR**: 

WISH over 7.9 will start filling the gap to 9.35 -&gt; buy shares or calls with 2 weeks till expiration on them.

OR 

Buy September 24th 7.5 calls right now and risk lows of 7.1 today and 7.2 on Tuesday in anticipation of breaking the daily/weekly long-term downtrend.",1
