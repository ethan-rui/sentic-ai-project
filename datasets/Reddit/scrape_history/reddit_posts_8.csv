2,ps15yj,2021-09-20,shartvilla,First post for the sharted,"Take a look a US gold Corp (usau).

Prelim economic assessment valued their copper king mine at approx 320m.
Due to be updated this month with a pre feasibility study which, with updated gold and copper prices together with better metallurgy results, should see a valuation north of 500m

Current market cap is 70m

Seriously potential for gains and that is without pricing in their other properties",2

If the people squeeze this the tendies could be massive. High SI on this one as well, so definitely can be squeezed, looks good long term but could possibly explode sooner rather than later.

Iâ€™m a bit of a gay bear scout, if you will. This morning I bought some long VIX calls, because this shit has the potential to get bad. I sold two a few hours in, and a bit later I find that (Iâ€™m a separate sell order) that RH sold the rest of my positions without my permission. The contracts I used to have are triple price now.
