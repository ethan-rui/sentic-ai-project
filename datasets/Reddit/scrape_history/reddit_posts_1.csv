[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw6nkg/tsla\_to\_aths\_and\_your\_account\_can\_be\_too\_if\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw6nkg/tsla_to_aths_and_your_account_can_be_too_if_you/)

I'm here again to tell you that this thing is not over. If you thought it was too late, think again. TSLA is on the verge of breaking the big psychological barrier of $800 and once it does so, it will be running to upper $800s or even the ATH of $900. See chart below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart of TSLA, Oct 2020 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/fsjn2qtdb3q71.png?width=1424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f6ca4c895ca75b9b9f473a0fa5ec9adc157f214)

As mentioned in my previous post, and as seen in early 2021 of the chart above, TSLA tends to breakout with strength. And by strength, I mean the strong possibility of 15%-20% weeks. It is possible that this week will be one of those weeks if TSLA can break the psychological $800 barrier. Lets do this together and lets all make some money here while helping out daddy Elon.

And if you're still on the fence, remember that TSLA is more than just an EV company. They years ahead of most EV companies out there and have their foot in the door of the power station industry, AI industry, Solar industry, etc. This is one of the most cutting edge companies out there and their valuation reflects how strongly investors feel about their growth in the future. Cheers to all who are able to make money!

As we've been approaching a point where all these overhyped companies in an overhyped market (on top of a failing economy) seem to be changing trajectory and are beginning to see similar degree if of failure to hold onto the (unholy degree of generally unjustified) traction they've built up for the span of that year-and-a-half since COVID, I've noticed a lot of rather sketchy plays being made alongside equally concerning reports being filed to the SEC (i.e. Boatloads of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, scathing risk disclosures which seem more like roadmaps than simply cautionary statements to properly inform investors).

One of the latest that's caught my attention comes from one of our ""very own"" hype beasts, Roblox, which has yet to be profitable by a long margin. This is pictured here :

&amp;#x200B;

So, following a rather rough day in the market, I decided to check on the company's SEC filings, and low-and-behold, we have a CFO buying calls in proportion to shares sold afterwards, which were also offloaded shortly after that. Here's the $RBLX CFO offloading 1/4th of his stock positions :

12,px1k9o,2021-09-28,leetcrew,Using stocks to help me buy my first car,"I’m new to the stock market, decided to put some money in TSLA and VOO as kind of a savings account, putting in around $150-250(aud) a week- has a better return than a savings account and is much more difficult to spend. My initial plan was to take out around $8000 and buy my first car, but i’m worried I won’t won’t to sell since i’ve invested in more long term stocks that look promising.  Any advice? 

Should I keep doing what i’m doing, or invest in a different stock? I don’t really want to have to wake up every morning and check the news for any change in the market, hence why I went with the Vanguard S&amp;P, and TSLA for a bit of fun.",1

18,pwtj5t,2021-09-27,lFUCK1,$ARL - American Realty Investors Inc Arbitrage Play with TCI Buyout,"American Realty Inc currently owns 78.4% of TCI per the most recent SEC quarterly report.

TCI owns many residential and commercial real estate buildings that they have acquired many years ago and have renovated/leased out.

TCI just received a buyout offer of 383 million at $44.40 per share from Brixton capital.

ARL is entitled to the 300m payout for its 78.4% of the proceeds.

ARL is currently trading at 217m market cap meaning there is a 38% upside once the deal closes. (assuming offer does not increase and excluding ARL equity)

This does not factor in if Brixton increases their offer which I fully expect as Brixton would not lead with their highest offer. 

TCI's assets have greatly appreciated from their cost as a result of inflation and increased real estate prices. Just look at their recent commercial building sale in August. TCI sold  600 Las Colinas commercial building after acquiring it 10 years ago at 42.2m for 74.5m. (75% increase) Most of TCI's assets have appreciated 50-75% over the past decade while its stock has remained fairly flat. 

TCI's real estate at cost amounts to 431 million and their fair market value is closer to 650m.

This alone would make TCI's share price worth around 70$ when factoring in TCI's equity + real estate at FMV. 

Brixton is tendering this offer for TCI as they realize the true value of real estate TCI is holding. I expect Brixton to increase their offer from 44.40$ up to as high as 55$ or 475m buyout which would still be undervaluing TCI's assets. 

This does not factor in ARL's other joint ventures and property outside of TCI.

ARL has 30m of equity on the books outside of TCI. (equivalent of 2$ a share)

**ARL Fair Value (383M buyout)**

=((383\*.784)+30M)/ 16.15M shares = $20.45$ (47% upside)

**ARL Fair Value (475M Buyout)**

=((475\*.784)+30M)/ 16.15M shares = $24.92 (80% upside)

ARL has a 1.48m float so once people figure out this it will run to 18-19$ fast.

PT: 20$ at the minimum, may run higher once we get more press releases about buyout negotiations. 

Disclosure: I am long $ARL until buyout has been finalized.",1
