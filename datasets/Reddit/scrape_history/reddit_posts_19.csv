17,pkuc95,2021-09-09,PrintOrBePrinted,Rho motherfucker. Do you understand it?,"I get it, y'all like your options.

You may even know what some of the Greeks actually mean.

Enter Rho. Nobody gave a shit about Rho. Nobody will have to for a while yet, but before long the red headed step child of the Greeks will be relevant again. 

I'm not going to explain what it is or how it affects your options prices, there are online resources for that you lazy fucks. 

Point is, inflation is here. Rates are going to have to increase to accommodate (disregard the fact that the US literally cannot pay its debts if the interest rates go up, but that's a subject for another time, preferably discussed from within a bunker somewhere).

When rates go up, Rho will increase the cost of your options. Options price go up, degenerate no happy.",1
