2,plohfk,2021-09-10,AppyWappy,The Short-Squeeze Corruption,"This sub hates short-sellers, in fact, it could probably claim credit for that mania that has now spread to hedge funds. Let's face it, the recent squeezes have been products of hedge funds, not retail investors. To that end, think of Nikola, an admittedly fraudulent company whose founder and CEO is facing a criminal trial. It still has a market cap of over $3 billion likely due to hedge funds trying to squeeze short-sellers. Obviously, the efficient market hypothesis is a lie, this is all a scam and a casino, but if there is anything left of your objective minds, doesn't it feel a bit gross that $3 billion dollars that could be working somewhere else in the economy is tied up in this fraud? The short-sellers are the most moral players in this madness.",2

23,ply8ta,2021-09-11,Mynameistowelie,"Lookinh for potential high growth, small-cap stocks under $50 share price with strong fundamentals.","Mine is currently WELL Health up 7,000% since IPO. 

Average cost was .92c it‚Äôs now sitting at $7.98 CAD at a dip from a high of $8.25C earlier this week.

Good quality of management with previous successful business, business model focuses on aggressive acquisition. 

Fundamentals are strong in that it has twice as much cash on hand to cover all liabilities not considering total assets. 

I strongly believe Digital health will be the future of the healthcare industry just as hoe online banking became inevitable. 

The pandemic has also provided this industry and sector as a strong catalyst for the need for more virtual medical care. 

They also own many in-person health care business as well. 

Revenue and EBIDTA increasing exponentially year over year. 

Looking for companies similar to this in different industries and sectors.",1
