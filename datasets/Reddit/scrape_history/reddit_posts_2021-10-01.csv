16,pzbmel,2021-10-01,LMo25,"Natural Gas Producers Aren‚Äôt the Best Way to Play Soaring Gas Prices. Look at Oil Producers Like Exxon, Royal Dutch, and Marathon Instead.","Shortages of natural gas and rising demand are leading to [an energy crunch](https://www.barrons.com/articles/exxon-sees-up-to-1-5-billion-third-quarter-earnings-boost-from-gas-and-oil-rally-51633090361?mod=hp_LATEST&amp;mod=article_inline) that has now spread around the world. Natural gas prices have soared to [new highs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gas-prices-spike-further-as-china-intensifies-fight-for-supply-51633083487?mod=hp_DAY_3&amp;mod=article_inline) this week, with European and Asian prices breaking all-time records over $30 per million British thermal units. In the U.S., prices recently hit intraday highs above $6 per mBtu, the highest level since 2014.

The straightforward way to play higher natural gas prices is to buy natural gas producers in the United States, the country that now produces the most natural gas in the world. But there‚Äôs a problem with that strategy. Most U.S. gas producers have hedged all or nearly all of their 2021 production at much lower prices, meaning that they‚Äôre not getting the benefit of the latest price surge. In fact, the top producers like [EQT ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/eqt)(ticker: EQT) and [CNX Resources ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/cnx)(CNX) have even hedged the bulk of their 2022 production, according to estimates from Truist analyst Neal Dingmann.

In general, gas companies used derivative financial instruments to lock in prices months ago, so the latest price surge probably won‚Äôt help them, Dingmann said in an interview.

‚ÄúAny of the hedges even for next year are well under $3,‚Äù Dingmann said.

There are a few gas producers that haven‚Äôt hedged as much. [Cabot Oil &amp; Gas ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/cog)(COG), for instance, had not hedged 2022 production as of its second quarter conference call. And [Chesapeake Energy ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/chk)(CHK) has light hedges, Dingmann said.

But there‚Äôs another way to play the natural gas boom. U.S. shale drillers known more for oil production often pump out considerable gas too. Historically, gas has made up a very small portion of their revenue, because gas prices have been extremely low for years. Dingmann expects third quarter earnings reports to show that gas is now a bigger portion of the revenue of oil producers.

‚ÄúYou go back a year and the comment from a lot of these same companies was that gas is down but it really doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîbecause even though it‚Äôs a third of our weighting, it‚Äôs only producing 5% of our revenue right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden, though, you go from $3 to $5 gas or propane that has quadrupled. I think that‚Äôs something that not many people have thought about yet into these third quarter calls in November.‚Äù

Investors ‚Äúare going to be very surprised‚Äù by how much these companies make from gas, he said. On Friday, [Exxon Mobil ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/xom)(XOM) said [in a securities filing](https://www.barrons.com/articles/exxon-sees-up-to-1-5-billion-third-quarter-earnings-boost-from-gas-and-oil-rally-51633090361?mod=hp_LATEST&amp;mod=article_inline) that it expects higher gas prices to add $500 million to $900 million worth of earnings to its third quarter report above second quarter numbers. That‚Äôs even more than it expects to make from higher oil prices.

Dingmann expects several oil companies to benefit from this phenomenon. Majors like Exxon and [Royal Dutch Shell ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/rds.b)(RDS.B) don‚Äôt tend to hedge their gas production, so they‚Äôll see large benefits from the price increase. Others like [Continental Resources ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/clr)(CLR) have kept their hedges light too, Dingmann notes. Continental‚Äôs production is 52% oil and 48% gas, and only an estimated 5% of its gas production was hedged in 2022, according to Dingmann. He also expects [Marathon Oil ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/mro)(MRO) to benefit, as 49% of its production is gas.

Oil companies could benefit from the gas surge in other ways too. Some utilities will likely switch their input fuel to oil from gas because of the surge in gas prices, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at IHS Markit, in an interview with Barron‚Äôs. That switching is ‚Äúpart of the reason oil is going up,‚Äù Yergin said. ‚ÄúWe think about 600,000 barrels of extra demand for oil is coming from the need to generate electricity.‚Äù

That said, a big bet on natural gas is dangerous now, because the commodity is already at such high levels and governments may take more drastic action to bring prices down so it doesn‚Äôt hurt consumers.

Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, said in an interview that investors shouldn‚Äôt expect the high prices to last. Already, local authorities in China have pushed factories to operate on abbreviated schedules and European power companies are starting to collapse.

‚ÄúMy sense is it‚Äôs not sustainable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see aggressive demand destruction and rationing.‚Äù

**Opinion:**

While I don't think that you can go wrong with a lot of the US Oil stocks given the elevated oil and gas prices (projections call for long-term elevated prices) **my opinion is that MRO (Marathon Oil) is best play for the following reasons**:

# MRO

* MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to **Stock Buy-Backs = Over $1 Billion for Q4-2021**
   * **When they pull the trigger on the buy-backs, the institutional investors will pour in**
   * That's currently 10% of their Market Cap, this will have a huge impact on the stock price
* MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel
* MRO paid down $1.4 Billion in long-term debt in Q1/Q2 of 2021
* MRO is the smallest Oil Company in the S&amp;P 500 (but not a Micro Cap that could be acquired easily)
* Bank of American and Goldman Sachs are predicting $80-100/barrel by end of 2021
* MRO (Marathon Oil) is up over 200% from October 2020
* There are other solid US Equity Oil plays out there, but I feel that MRO is in the best position to boom given their solid balance sheet, low-break even point, and being the smallest market cap company of any US Oil Company in the S&amp;P 500 (i.e. institutional/long-term investors will be more likely to pour money into an S &amp; P 500 company than a micro cap once it's fully realized that oil US companies are committed to investor returns vs the old ""drill baby drill"" mentality.
* \*I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict. But if you have options that you are confident about, please share in the comments

First,  I looked at valuation. I think comparing SDC to Byte is pretty fair.  They run very similar businesses with a few differences. Byte does have  proprietary system if you are willing to pay a little extra. Besides  that, they are very similar companies. Dentsply purchases Byte in  January for $1B. Based on that I did a little calculating:

https://preview.redd.it/vntqih1e5vq71.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd96919c99d741bf3f08f4ee8619be433cd9ee3c

Based  on what Dentsply paid for Byte, SDC should be valued around $5B.  Putting the share price around $10. If I compared SDC to Invisalign,  this numbers would be even higher.

For  you retards that think SDC‚Äôs numbers are trash, please look at this  report from the first few years that Invisalign (Align) went public:

https://preview.redd.it/m53ma3iu5vq71.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1a145c3a5dbf40913ba70806a8b46cf4bb0780

Now compare that to SDC over the last 3 years:

https://preview.redd.it/20fzvpww5vq71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b48f4389e46160f22bcf4ddc5410b8aef00939

Sure,  SDC‚Äôs revenue decreased in 2020, but they are on pace to bounce back to  $750-800M in 2021. Still, if you compare SDC‚Äôs numbers for the first 2  years they were public to ALIGN‚Äôs numbers when they went public, SDC is  very competitive.

I already know  people will say ‚Äúthe product is cheap‚Äù or ‚Äútheir reviews are terrible‚Äù. I  will start by saying that ALIGN and SDC were in a partnership from 2016  to 2020. They shared technology and sometimes made retainers for each  other. The partnership ended due to violation of noncompeting clauses.  Next, feel free to compare their number of complaints to the number of  complaints for Byte.

https://preview.redd.it/wsdts0zy5vq71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa8a7d04c5db9bc3b90979f3ea142f8ee61cb2ce

https://preview.redd.it/2twpobk16vq71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73d8beeda09fd0e637999b11d673ee747d019831

Assuming  Byte has about 1/4 the number of clients, since they have a quarter of  the revenue, the number of complaints filed against them is comparable  to SDC. I do realize their customer reviews are better, but SDC has had  terrible media coverage while Byte has not. Their 4 star rating could be  reflected of the negative coverage.

Also, look at the ownership:

Institutions own about 70% of SDC.

SDC  CEO, David Katzman, owns over 1,278,130 units and has not sold a single  share. He is a great investor with plenty of successful businesses  under his belt. He wouldn‚Äôt hold if this company was trash. I'm not  selling a share until he does.

Obviously, do your own DD and don‚Äôt rely on my biased bullshit. But, don‚Äôt come in here talking ‚Äúfacts‚Äù because you‚Äôre a ‚Äúdentist‚Äù.

And yes, this is a deSpac trade idea, if you cannot stomach a risky play, feel free to step away. Update:

&amp;#x200B;

* redemption rate at **74%**
* **25,887,987** shares were redeemed
* current float at **9,112,013**
* short interest is around **35%,** and this was on the day of business meeting of which price was at $10. It has been sold down to a current price of 6.35 which is a drawdown of around 37%, and im pretty sure shorts may have added on their positions, be it shares or puts
* if I am not mistaken, 3.2M share short divided by the current float = 35%

What happens now? I really do not know. de-Spac plays lately are not materializing, but this could turn to be a crowded play if we get lucky, just my opinion. Either were bottom fishing or were basically catching falling knives. Cut your losses if the trade doesnt materialize, jack-off with your fave lube if it does!

79,pzat03,2021-10-01,1poundbookingfee,"How Zillow, Redfin and Opendoor manipulate the single family residential/house market","TLDR: They are damn smart, will cause house prices to rise, but I'm not Michael Burry autismo yet to bet against any of them. 

TLDR2: They buy a few key houses, artificially inflate the price, borrow against that asset, use that collateral as more cash, and buy more houses in strategic areas. It's like fractional reserve banking but with houses. 

I trade mortgage backed securities. Actually nah, I'm just a real estate agent and I'm salty. Actually I am a teller at a money center bank and I say I'm an investment banker on Tinder. But actually I just give BJs behind your local Wendy's. You can trust me. 

Zillow, Redfin and Opendoor has been involved in buying single family homes for the past 2 years now. Buying a house for 200k and then flipping for 250k, believe it or not, is not the main way their single family house (here onward abbreviated with SF) business makes money. Of course they want prices to go up, but they do it in a much more strategic way. 

When Zillow (this is the prime example I will use going forward) wants to develop a market, they will go out and offer higher bids. You can almost preview which markets they want to get into by comparing their Zestimate with either the local tax appraisal amount (for areas where appraisals are annual like TX) or recently sold records (like CA). They will bid around 20% higher for around a portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses. 

After they buy the initial portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses, they will place maybe 1 or 2 for sale. Fixing it up is optional. These houses will be near or higher than the local average, because they are playing with data. In Austin, where hot houses near market price sell within 5 days, Zillow houses often are on the market for 2-4 weeks. They don't need to sell it, and often don't want to because they are creating a data point. 

So what happens with that 50% marked up house? A withdrawn listing is not good for both the house in the future (people may wonder if there are structural or physical problems) and not good for the area (no bids). They simply buy it back using one of their smaller funded vehicles. Because they have their own realtors, the transaction cost is minimal and much less than what happens next for them to make money. Great, now that previous house which cost $1 million has sold for $1.5 million. Everyone sees that. 

With that freshly minted $1.5 million record, they are able to raise the estimates of the other houses of the 5-10 initial purchases by around 50%. Do they sell those houses? Well no, because as we've seen, there are no bids at that inflated price. They take that appraisal record, and go ask for a loan from whoever wants to invest in their real estate-backed vehicle (mostly Blackrock and by extension a bunch of pension funds). 

So that house they originally bought for $1 million, has a public and documented value of $1.5 million. For Zillow, they can get around 80% LTV, so $1.5\*80% = $1.2 million in new cash. What do they do? They take the cash to a new area, buy up new houses and the cycle continues. 

Is there a problem with this? I ain't no commie and I already have my own shack so I don't have any complaints. Will there be a problem? Well, what if values start to decrease? Well, apart from the 2008 blip, real estate prices in the US have always gone up. That's what everyone said until they were punched in the face. If there is going to be a decrease in demand (more rentals, or as old people start dying off and leaving houses to their kids) or supply or everyone deciding to move out of the shithole that is San Francisco and Los Angeles, you'd expect houses to go down. If the house price decreases to maybe around 50% LTV, there may be margin calls. 

So essentially, it might be a repeat of 2008. This time, Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie have been replaced by Blackrock and a bunch of private funds (post 2008, a large part of the foreclosed houses were owned by Fannie/Freddie and sold off one by one). The average American borrower has been replaced by Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor. The only difference this time is that the numbers are bigger, and Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor for how has a magic money machine called local price manipulation.",1,wallstreetbets
