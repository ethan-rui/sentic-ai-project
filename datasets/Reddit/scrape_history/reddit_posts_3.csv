**Why I am short SDC**

SDC, or Short Dis Company rather, is a low cost alternative to Align’s Invisalign in the form of 3d printed clear aligners. The TLDR of my thesis is that SDC has a poor business model due to failing fundamentals. My position on this company is that it is a strong sell with a target price of a controversial $nil. I do not believe that the current business model is sustainable, and I do not see this company operating in the next 3 years. My valuation of SDC was based on liquidation value as I believe SDC to currently be factually insolvent, in a cash losing position and will require the bailout and support of shareholders to dig it out of its current insolvent position.

**Background**

SDC has been in the market since 2014 and was initially in partnership with Align. This partnership was severed after SDC claimed Align abused confidential information resulting in Align giving up its ownership for a payment of $45.5m from SDC (which is still outstanding).

**Growth model**

The bulk of SDC’s growth is due to the opening of new business locations, the latest list of operations is as follows, France is the next country of entry for the company;

Additionally to the above, SDC is attempting to achieve growth by entering into a new product line, a travel toothbrush;

**Strategic concerns**

Issue 1 – New product line. The design of the travel toothbrush would require a period of time before being ready to go to market. It seems almost ludicrous that SDC would bring a travel toothbrush to market when there is a global ongoing pandemic that limits and prohibits much travelling. It would be comical to consider SDC management brainstorming this product in the midst of a pandemic. One would think that there is a better use of limited resources at the disposal of SDC.

Issue 2 – Target market of SDC. SDC products are geared towards low-income households. This is evidenced by the practice of SDC offering payment plans as well as being marketed as a cheaper option to Invisalign. My concern with the offering payment plans, is that the world is economically in limbo due to covid. This means there is even greater risk on the outstanding balances receivable from customers, especially as the focus of this product is towards lower income households. Furthermore, lower income households that have a decrease in earnings would not be prioritising teeth straightening products. Ideally this product would be suited for poorer 3rd world countries which lack the dentistry infrastructure, however the cost of SDC places them out of that market entirely.

Fundamental flaws

The financials of SDC have always been poor. They are loss making as well as being incredibly overleveraged resulting in the perfect cocktail for a financial disaster. I will look at the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement individually.

**Income statement**

I took the annual income statements as well as Q1 and Q2 of 2021, I took those numbers and extrapolated for a 12 month period in order to do comparable of assessments. NB, the income statement is over a period of time, which means that we need the full period to be included.

Annual income statements

Semi-annual income statement

Multiple the 6 months ended June 30 by 2 in order to get to an annual comparative to the annual income statements.

As you can see the company is loss making and has been from 2017. The worst year for SDC was 2019 with a $500m loss booked. The company is set to make a loss of $300m in the current year, second worst set of results only behind 2019. Based on 2021 quarterly results SDC lost $150m in 6 months. This works out to a loss of $25m a month

Sales of SDC has been growing, with the current year set to be the second most successful year, behind 2019. It seems that the overheads associated with converting and generating sales results in a greater loss for the company. In my opinion, there is an indication that the company needs to focus on its core business structure and make that efficient and profitable before trying to grow product lines and operate in foreign countries.

The GP% is improving year on year. In 2021 its expected to be 75% which is an improvement over 2017 which was 56%. This indicates that the cost behind 3d printing has become cheaper as technology develops. This does raise an area of concern, as it becomes even more cheaper the barrier to entry reduces as well. This may mean that over the next few years competition may increase if the business model does find success.

An item of interest for me is the Store related costs and impairments. In 2020 $20m of assets were impaired. This means the assets were overstated and future cash flows from those assets were not expected to cover the carrying value to the tune of $20m. This could also indicate that there are deeper issues with the ability of SDC as an organisation to continue to operate at a profitable level. Store closures in both 2021 and 2020 is never a good sign, although it possible to overlook this if the primary reasons for these closures was a reduce in foot traffic as a result of covid.

**Balance sheet**

The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company at a point in time, this means we only need to look at one period to understand its current financial position as at June 30, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

[Look at those juicy liabilities and skimpy equity figures](https://preview.redd.it/5wb7p3qn8qp71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195aceeede1056b08c91fe3ebf2770cede43f1b9)

SDC does not have any liquidity issues, there is more than sufficient cash to cover all of their current liabilities.

My main concern with SDC is that their capital structure is extremely over leveraged. They do not have enough equity on the balance sheet to withstand further loses. If SDC loses another $34m in the period from July to December 2021 (the expectation is $150m or $300m for the year) SDC will be factually insolvent. This loss seems inevitable and the only way SDC can stay afloat and be in a positive equity position in order to absorb this loss will be to issue new shares. I have a strong feeling that this will be announced in the upcoming meeting which is going to be held on Monday September 2021. As mentioned SDC loses approximately $25m a month which means that their June position of $34m less 3 months of losses (July, August and September) results in their financial position, or book value to be negative $41m. In my opinion the company is trading in a negative equity position which will need to be assisted via an issue of additional shares.

Cash flow

I am not going to include the full cash flow, but will provide the following extract for the three full financial years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygv90evq8qp71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d005a3302bdbe9f02aedeb83a702559d33116d

[023e2bff-6ce1-41fb-9cbf-53c9ff660d33 (smiledirectclub.com)](https://investors.smiledirectclub.com/static-files/023e2bff-6ce1-41fb-9cbf-53c9ff660d33)

The cash flow statement is broken down into these three main components, operating activities (their core business), investing activities (buying and selling of fixed assets) and financing activities (receipts and paying back of loans and shareholder funding)

The key takeaway from the cash flow statement is that they are constantly losing money in their day-to-day operations. The other activities are mostly one off and non-reoccurring. SDC is currently burning through cash and will require further financing from investors or lenders in order to keep it in a healthy cash position.

**Conclusion**

SDC is a failing company, currently insolvent and has little prospects of surviving over the next few years.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/phx-minerals-inc-announces-closing-of-acquisitions-in-the-haynesville-play-301384880.html

I was intrigued by the tiny market cap of $83M. *Low liquidity and volume should be noted*. Anyway, I got sidetracked looking to PHX bc they have 250k acres of oil and gas production spread throughout the US. They are not focused  on the Haynesville area only (so I am not sure if they fit the profile that I was looking for with regard to TELL). 

That said, it may be a potential target for someone. Decent portfolio of production and just got more acreage in the hot hanyesville area where there have recently been quite a bit if merger/acquisitions due to the proximity to LNG export ports. Recently, CHK bought Vine. Southwestern bought Indigo. Geosouthern is reportedly in talks (hopefully with Tellurian). Rockcliff had a closed bid on haynesville assets last month. Lots of activity in the region and nat gas industry. 

Nat gas prices are on fire across the globe. While export from US is the best play IMO, small companies like PHX will likely be indirect beneficiaries through possible buyouts. Floor will be in place if Henry Hub holds around $4 or $5.
