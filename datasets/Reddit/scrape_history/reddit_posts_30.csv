Despite that fact it has only created 2 good trades other triggers ended up as false starts or balks.

8/24 there was a midday alert that had gone off. The break of $40 was the new trigger.

[consolidation zone and subsequent break](https://preview.redd.it/8r5mws5akbk71.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d5a1f4055be3d71371210532a778cdfd5ca26af)

Volume instantly came in and because of the unique structure of this stock i manage it slightly different than i do the others. The main difference is that i am willing to scale out of my position rather than trail for one exit, the reason for it is the exaggerated rotation of the float and the rogue wave like volume increases. In other words AMC is ironically the only stock where my hands are in diamond form for the least amount of time.

The price point on the chart i was most interested in was the level just under 50. It was noted to be a significant area of price and volume. I was very confident that if this level were to break we would be seeing a major moon run as the imbalance of supply and demand above this point would be near its most extreme.

&amp;#x200B;

Bruce Lee said ""Hands like water"" .... No not really, he said ""...be like water"" a parallel quote we find in our game is "" Strong opinions weakly held"" the quote has been attributed to many traders so i haven't verified the source, though i did first hear it in one of the market wizards book, but if Bruce was a trader i believe he'd say ""true dat"".. Once that target was hit i used it to scale and to adjust my stops. Once the market closes i resume my diamond hand status until the price action tells me different.

I was disappointed when AMC could not break that level on day 2, i really wanted to see this MOON, but the market doesn't give a flying F$%# what any of us wants, i takes money from us on our birthdays, the day of our grandmas funeral and would rip our faces off even if our dog got hit by a garbage truck. So what do you do? you F#$% it back and guess what, you could rip a million dollars from it and it wouldn't skip a beat

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2 i was stopped out pretty quickly. There was a gut check when the stock rallied back towards the high. The best part was i had an order ready to get back in, it wasn't filled and the stock fizzled out of favor. The most important thing in this game is hit and don't get hit, win more than you lose and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

This trade wasn't the biggest, but it was a clear example of asymmetric risk and not letting expectations guide your decisions or alter your system. Even though it had a 1R profit result, it was open 2R in less than 1 hour and it had the potential of really opening up and paying us all.

**IAM Media scoop on Friday (legit site specializing in Intellectual Property that first broke the $BB patent sale news 9 months ago)** 

[https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021](https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual\_Asset\_Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Asset_Management)

""Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry‚Äôs patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It‚Äôs almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry‚Äôs 38,000-strong portfolio of patents ‚Äúrelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies‚Äù, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these ‚Äì or the many other stories doing the rounds ‚Äì are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note ‚Äì the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

If you take a look at form 4 for CEO, the CFO, general council and the secretary are selling shares! They were even selling 100 dollars below the 283 close Friday.

It took INTU many years to be a 27 billion dollar company.. They actually missed estimates with a loss of 7 cents missing by 3 cents. Revenue was 78 million growth of 86%...

The outlook on the next quarter is a loss of 3-5 million.. This is a 27 billion dollar company that even sees full next years sales at 476 to 480 million. They are expected to lose 88-92 cents a share that‚Äôs about 75 million‚Ä¶. Am I missing something here?

23,pec7aa,2021-08-30,hockey_bettor,USA USA USA TODAY ‚Äì Your grandma's newspaper is undervalued and ready to pop,"Extreme negative sentiment towards and industry can create incredible investing bargains. When everybody thinks a business is dying a slow death it's easy to give up on the stock or pile on and short it into oblivion. But Wall Street is often wrong, creating **opportunity for the rest of us.** 

Gannett Co. **(GCI)** is a 114 year-old media company that publishes USA Today and hundreds of other newspapers across America and the UK. The newspaper ad business has gone to shit sending the stock into a multi-year tailspin. **The stock fell from nearly $19 in 2018 to around $6.50 today.**  Management saw the writing on the wall and undertook to transform the business through an aggressive digital strategy that is still in its early stages. 

The company has had success gaining digital subscribers to paywalled content among some of its regional newspapers and it's now bringing that strategy to its flagship publication, USA Today. With a paywall up on some content. **This is the same strategy that has helped propel New York Times Stock to all-time highs.** Now, USA Today will never be the NYT, but if it can garner even a fraction of the subscribers the stock is tremendously undervalued and **could easily hit $10 or more.** 

# Valuation

A look at valuations tells us that Gannett is **valued at less than 1/10th** of the New York Times based on price to sales ratio. Gannett consistently pulls in higher quarterly revenues yet its market cap is less than $1-billion compared to $8-billion for the NYT. 

**GCI Price to sales ‚Äì 0.39** 

**NYT price to sales ‚Äì 4.47**

Of course the big difference here is that NYT is profitable while Gannett has been losing money spending on its transformation. However GCI turned profitable last quarter and its digital side is showing promising growth. **Q2 digital revenues grew 33 per cent over the prior year and digital revenues now make up 32 per cent of all revenues.** Sometime soon Gannett will make more money from its digital products than its print products, these revenues are both faster growing and higher margin. **The successful turnaround is about to become obvious sending the stock way higher (it is has only just recovered its pre-pandemic level).** 

# Chart

I'm not much of a line-drawer but even I can see that this stock has been consolidating for six months and is on the verge of breaking out. **Above $6.60 there isn't a shred of resistance until we hit $8. That's a 22 per cent gain.**

# Misc. 

Gannett is hiring tech talent, recently hiring Nate Rackiewicz from Take Two as their Chief Data Officer, they are clearly very serious about becoming a digital publishing behemoth. It also recently concluded a deal with Tipico, an online sports betting site, giving Gannett a finger in that growing pie as well. 

# Shorts? 

Anybody else sick of hearing that there is short squeeze potential in every DD? Well with Gannett there actually is. 11.6 per cent of the shares are sold short, but, given the relatively low average volume the **short ratio (days to cover) is 9.4.**

# Risks

Gannett does have a fair bit of debt at somewhat unfriendly terms. If the transformation goes as planned and the anticipated years of earnings growth materializes this should not be a huge issue.
