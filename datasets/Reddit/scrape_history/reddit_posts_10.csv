7,pqreug,2021-09-18,jsam333,Need everyone's help petitioning to actually create a WSB ETF,"STOP SCROLLING YES THAT MEANS YOU

Okay now that I have your attention, copy this paragraph: The fund tracks sentiment of r/wallstreetbets. It automatically invests into shares based on the percent of daily ticker mentions on WSB posts and comments weighted by the number of upvotes. It will be popular due to recent public interest in the sub.

Then, [click right here.](https://etfmg.com/contact-us/) Enter whatever info you want and in the dropdown menu select ""I have an idea for a fund"", then paste into the box below and hit submit.   üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåë

I feel like an ETF of the sentiment of this sub is the holy grail. To let degenerates like you and me have access to everyone else's crazy trades while putting in even less effort into DD than usual. Looking into how to make an ETF I learned it takes millions of dollars of startup capital and I don't have that kind of time or money. The smart play was to have someone else do the work for all of us on this sub. That's why everyone needs to visit [this link](https://etfmg.com/contact-us/) (ETF Managing Group) to express your support for a WSB ETF.

I've seen plenty of sentiment tracking algos here so maybe someone smarter than I can recommend to the fund managing group how to make one. Everyone here has to help pitch this fund idea through the link. This way we can make ez endless gains for all.

Is this the best way to go about creating an ETF while broke or is there a better way that I missed?",1

Later decided to sell covered calls which expired on 9/17/21. Yesterday rolls around and RH decided to sell 7 of my options for x amount per contract instead of just selling my 700 shares for the strike price ? I‚Äôd send ss and stuff but apparently can‚Äôt post this company. I was under the assumption they go after your shares, why would they sell my contracts?",1
