BEAM GLOBAL (T-BEEM) IS THE BEST SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITY OF 2021👍🔥💎💎💎💎🌋🌋⚡☀⭐💣💣💥💥💥💥MATH RETAILERS NEEDED TO ANALYZE THE STOCK. IT SEEMS TO BE GOING UNDER THE RADAR,Somebody do the math for me please. I heard a really good arguement on why Beem is the best short squeeze of the year.  I just don't remember all the details as this usually is not my department. I know little but the basics of shorting.  But he knew what he was talking about and wanted somebody to spread the word in Wallstreetbets.,1
24,pftj19,2021-09-01,Corgi-Civil,Should I Sell $A (Agilent Tech.) ?,"Hey fellow investors,

So on June 24th I bought $13.57 worth in $A (Agilent) and bought some more once I saw it was going up. My question to you is do you think that I should keep buying into $A (Agilent) or keep me 23 percent profit? From what I put in 25% profit is like 5 dollars anyways. One reason that im looking at selling is also because this stock is hand and hand with healthcare resources, research and equipment production. Therefore, as the virus get more and more under control I'm afraid that the stock will plummet. However, With the delta they're going to need vials which is one of the many products that this stock produces. If I did sell this stock id split the money 3-ways between VUG and 2 other ofmy growth holdings. Thank you for your feedback.",1
