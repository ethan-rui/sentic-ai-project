1,pnh3s4,2021-09-13,Sea-Consideration495,US Gov misreporting about rent inflation," Anyone who has renewed a lease recently has probably been shocked to see the rate increase dramatically over the last year. Most private source show between a 10-15% increase in average rent in the last year.

The US CPI however has only shown a 2.8% increase in the shelter category.

What could be causing this huge discrepancy between what everyone is noticing and what the government is reporting. I know the gov has a bias to report lower inflation Because high inflation leads to higher interest rates and social security payouts which both would are huge expenditures by the gov. Higher interest rates could also lower home prices and stocks valuations. So what do you guys think? Is the gov purposefully misreporting the rent aspect of CPI to try to keep interest rates lower for longer?",2
