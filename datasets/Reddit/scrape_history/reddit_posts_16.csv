This sure depends on the type of payments and the feasibility of disturbing the user experience (by bringing the player/user outside the app)... but I am sure that companies will come up with ways to cope with that in order to save the hundreds of millions currently paid to Apple.

Until more work is done, I found this table (source Stifel) to help with initial screen. ZNGA SCPL RBLX and PLTK should benefit the most. Full table [here](https://imgur.com/a/iLW4b1A). Copied because I cant post images here

7,pn1qwf,2021-09-12,gohackthat,Options Trading Part I (How to Pick the Right Options) - 9/12/2021," 

Hello investors,

In this memo, I wanted to talk about how to pick the right options.

I've seen many videos that talk about options, like making monthly income through selling options. While these are great points, I wanted to start from a more fundamental standpoint and understand options from a broader level.

I'm also going to skip the definitions of calls and put options for simplicity purposes.

I think the basics of options can be learned better through reading pages like Investopedia.

Options are mainly used by professionals to hedge their positions. For example, if you have positions in DIS, and you think DIS stock will plummet in the near term, you want to protect your stocks by buying put options.

There's also a very popular strategy, often used by Warren Buffett as well, where you sell covered puts so that you can buy expensive stocks at cheaper levels. I will be covering these in future memos so make sure to follow Midasinvestors if you'd like to see those.

In this memo, I will be covering which call options to buy when you are confident in the stock's price movement.

For example, if you want to buy a call option on a stock because you think the stock will outperform in the short term, which strike price should you buy and what expiration date?

To answer these questions, you need to find out what the risk/reward ratios are.

For instance, in a coin flip, let's say you gain $100 on heads and you lose $100 on tails. It's a 50/50 game and your expected return is $0 ($100 x 50% + -$100 X 50%).

Another coin flip game gives you $200 on heads and you lose $100 on tails. The expected return is $50 on this game ($200x50% + -$100x50%).

So you definitely want to play this game. Why? Because risk/reward is in your favor, meaning your gains are larger than your losses for the same chances of each happening.

This is what's called having a ""positive convexity"" risk/reward.

It's exactly the same concept in not just options but anything actually.

Look at the below risk/reward profile for PDD call option.

\[picture of PDD total return profile\]

images are not allowed here so if you want to check out graphs, please check out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) or YouTube channel.

This is a graph of a total return profile for PPD call option in different scenarios. This assumes that you bought the option today and held it until 11/30/2021 for about 2.5 months.

On 11/30, you would have 52 days left until expiration.

Say if a stock price goes down 30%, you lose 100% of your premium and if the stock price goes up 30%, you gain 146% on your premium.

You apply the exact same concept with the coin flip here.

Your stock goes down 30% and you lose 100%. Your stock goes up 30% but you gain 146%. This is a positive convexity risk/reward profile.

However, the major difference is that if the stock doesn't move at all, you lose 75% of your money due to theta decay, which will be covered in future memos. This is a very important point and you should follow this strategy only if you expect large price movements in the underlying stock.

Now back to the discussion. What we are trying to determine is what exercise price and expiration date we should buy.

I currently hold this call option in PDD. This one expires in 4 months with $130 strike price, and the stock closed at $104.

I have this position and my potential exit date is 2.5 months from now, on 11/30/2021.

At the expiration date, I will only have 1.5 months left. That is not an ideal situation because ideally, I want to have at least 2 months left until expiration. This is because the value of money that you lose each day due to theta decay on options gets exponentially higher within the 2 months of expiration.

Next, my holding period, as discusssed before, will be about 2.5 months from now.

Stock price is currently at $104 and the option premium is $5.3, or $530 because each option consists of 100 stocks.

When the stock price unchanged by 11/30, your total loss is 75%, meaning you lose 75% of your option premium.

This loss due to theta decay, meaning you lose the time value of the option so it's very important that you expect some type of volatility when purchasing options.

Delta is percentage change in the premium of the option per 1 % change in the underlying stock price.

Basically, the higher the delta, the higher the option premium movement per 1% movement in the stock price.

Theta is how much you lose per day on the premium due to time decay. Every day, your option premium goes down because that time value of option loses value due to shorter time to expiration.

Finally, the return on investment is what you want to pay attention to.

If the stock goes down by 30%, you will most likely lose 100% of your option premium.

If the stock goes up 30%, you can gain close to 150%, or more than double your money.

As mentioned before, you want this upside to be the highest as possible, with as low theta decay as possible.

I have capital gains on the call right now and I'm trying to determine whether to sell this or not.

I am still very confident in the stock's performance but I think there may be some turbulence in the short term so I want to decrease my risk exposure.

So 2 main goals: 1) extend time horizon and 2) reduce risk.

One way to accomplish these goals is to find which options to roll into.

Let's compare my current call option with another call option that expires in April 2022 with a higher strike price at $150.

The total return profiles look pretty close right?

I know the total return on the new position may be lower than the current one but the great benefit of buying this new call option is that my expiration date is further out.

At the end of my assumed holding period until 11/30/2021, I still have 4.5 months left until expiration.

Generally speaking, I like to have at least 4 months until expiration when I sell my options. So if I buy a 8-month call option and 4 months goes by, I decide to sell it or roll into other options.

So this new call option allows me to achieve 1) similar total returns and 2) extend my time horizon.

I'm also going to reinvest only 80% of my proceeds from the original call option to reduce risk.

I know there are a lot of moving pieces in options but the main idea I wanted to get across is assessing the risk/reward for any investment that you are making, whether it be options, stocks, MBA degree, or buying a house.

When you're buying options, buy the ones that will have the greatest convexity, meaning the biggest gains for % price change upwards compared to % price change downwards.

This can usually be done via purchasing far OTM options.

Everyone's goal should be to get more bang for their buck.
