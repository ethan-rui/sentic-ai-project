15,pfduo2,2021-08-31,misterBLOB96,Cross post! Stock has KIID!,"This [company](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/III/3i-group-plc/company-page) does apparently have a KIID. Such document is only needed for small retail clients in EU to purchase funds, but this isnâ€™t a fund, itâ€™s a company. 

I find this to be very weird. Itâ€™s and investment company, but it still doesnâ€™t mean it should have a KIID. Anyone with more experience in this matter? 

FYI: KIID=key investor information document",1

17,pffj3f,2021-08-31,TheBazaarTrades,Why GSAT will be the next big thing,"I'd like to direct everyone's attention to the ticket GSAT. Rumors of buy out prior to apple's interest to satellite services and what have you. 

From my understanding, what seems to be correct from the rumors are  

'Apple Inc.â€™s push to bring satellite capabilities to the iPhone will be focused on emergency situations, allowing users to send texts to first responders and report crashes in areas without cellular coverage. 

The company is developing at least two related emergency features that will rely on satellite networks, aiming to release them in future iPhones, according to a person with knowledge of the situation'.

This chart shares, looks, and feels just like AMC &amp; GME all over again. Best entry to get into is the support line at 1.7. You definitely want it to break 2.4 or higher but should all else fails, exit at 1.65 no less, no fomo.",1
