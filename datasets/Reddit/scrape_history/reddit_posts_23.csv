I've heard from several big brands that they no doubt will be limited in what they can put on the shelf this holiday and into Q1, if not longer. Most still have enough product to meet current demand, but holiday will reveal the shortages that have been bubbling up for months. I assume retailers will issue significantly lower guidance after holiday, and retail will sell off for quarter or two. Does retail have enough sway to trigger something larger, or will traders simply rotate into something else?",1
