0,pre6v2,2021-09-19,CarKey1999,SDC- Bollinger Band Float+CTB+Volume Breakout,"The Mods removed my last post pertaining to SDC. Mods have been removing and shadowbanning numerous SDC DD, for no legitimate reason. Here's another one because, why not?

[Ortex SI](https://preview.redd.it/7x8dhhkuaio71.jpg?width=446&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c077a2f07bda4d1ca34dfa280ea62763a1ef63)

&amp;#x200B;

[CTB, DTC, Increased SI.](https://preview.redd.it/xkxpoxhxaio71.jpg?width=615&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1e6cbf5b7fe24957407ce699689da1939cbe98)

* *104,310,000 million share float and 48.12% of it is shorted.*
* **104,310,000 \* .4812 = 50,193,972 shares that are currently shorted.**

SDC has had a 9.54% increase in short ratio in a week's span. With approximately 5.67 days to cover, this is considered *extremely difficult* due to the limited timeline and increase in CTB. *This means they are obligated to cover their shares this week.*

**Bollinger Band Chart** 

‚ÄúAfter a period of consolidation, the price often makes a larger move in either direction, ideally on high volume. Expanding volume on a breakout is a sign that traders are voting with their money that the price will continue to move in the breakout direction.‚Äù

As you can see, the Bollinger Bands can provide use for determining volatility movements. The arrows point at narrow action.

&amp;#x200B;

[BB TA](https://preview.redd.it/wqf6c8j2bio71.jpg?width=623&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa7e5d46293e011a9b2a87fbea15ab02e3d3b19a)

**In short:** 

In typical movements, the bands keep a safe distance.

In volatile movements, the bands can become narrow; moving closer towards the middle band, or SMA.

**If you‚Äôre too retarded to understand, this means that narrow=tendiez.**

The final detail to this chart is the occurrence of ovals. Upright ovals have signaled an uptrend, while downright ovals signal a downtrend. 

*Not even after a full 24 hours, we saw 2 oval occurrences that led to an uptrend.* 

**Predictions:**

9/17/21 AH Bollinger has become narrow.. **We have yet again, another opportunity to catch hedge funds with their dicks out.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Consolidation to a Breakout](https://preview.redd.it/kcxu53g5bio71.jpg?width=622&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c6c04c83b3e743a39721ef888fdc1719fc86e6)

I have highlighted the narrow occurrences with a white rectangle; I have also indicated the consolidation in price action with purple crayon. The rectangle on the right is capturing a potential uptrend, one that can EXCEED the resistance of $7.41. Since the stock has consolidated at a higher price, it‚Äôs only logical to hypothesize a spike greater than before.

CTB is also steadily increasing which means that they are willingly spending more to cover their position. The fact is, they are losing- and doing whatever is possible to stay afloat.

**What happened here?**

&amp;#x200B;

[They got scared.](https://preview.redd.it/z3lkngipbio71.jpg?width=623&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15edf18dd9e99d10fd23ff4cc8f48851160c8e48)

Our support is $6.36 while our resistance is $7.41. Obviously, a massive sell wall is what prevented us from rallying further. Again, we have another opportunity.

**Bollinger Bandwidth: Measures distance between Bollinger Bands.** 

Low BBW= squeeze indication

High BBW= no squeeze indication. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BBW](https://preview.redd.it/yilh5r3ybio71.jpg?width=621&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7423eb7bae008be4ecad14de355d807b33704e59)

**September 17:** We saw the **BBW (Yes, Big Beautiful Women)**, drop beneath .05. Then, the price action got hard as fuck.

**How many of you idiots got laid last night? How about this week? Oh, none? Maybe if you actually grew some balls and didn‚Äôt have scared money you‚Äôd actually get some bitches on your dick.** 

Now, we are at another point in time where the BBW is beneath .05. It‚Äôs self-explanatory what will happen next. Will you continue to sit with your dick flaccid or will you hop in and get some action?

For those who FOMO‚Äôd into IRNT, here‚Äôs your redemption play. 

Here are other DD‚Äôs of SDC brainiacs.

For some reason I was scrolling through the CNBC app this morning just to find an article that would blow me away..

This very specific article inspired me as a young degenerate and really made me believe that there are simple ways to make money trading stocks.

I advise everyone to read this article and start respecting the investor that is mentioned and goed by the name of  Paul Gambles for these two reasons:

1: First of all, this man is named GAMBLES which couldn‚Äôt fit the WSB gang better.

2: Moreover, mr. Paul Gambles is a man known for his DD as he warns investors in the article that ‚Äòthe financial markets
appear vulnerable to what could be an extreme move in EITHER direction‚Äô, referring to a certain legendary quote once spoken by the actor Matthew McConaughey. 
 

If only we had more degenerates who could take their DD to this level‚Ä¶

24,prmx55,2021-09-20,beardumm,Free crypt0 currency game!,"Hello all, so I was on Reddit one day and found a post about a free geocache style/pokemon go style game which gives you free crypt0 currency no strings attached.

So I started playing it and I'm hooked. I've played a couple months and have received approximately $500-$600 US dollars (depending on the fluxuaction of the crypt0 market) and after I while I noticed I didn't even care about the crypt0 and started playing for the fun if it and gained so much knowledge along the way as you answer trivia questions and when you get it right you get free crypt0currency.

So basically you you walk around with your character on a mapped out version of the city (your city or where ever you might go) and there are keys you collect which open vaults which are everywhere..when you use a key to open the corresponding (colour) vault it opens a trivia question you answer and if answered correctly you win and get free crypt0 and resources for the game (irrelevant to the crypt0). Anyways I'm hooked and referrals do give out extra keys for me and yourself. The game just came out of beta (2 weeks ago or so) and is live for Andriod devices and there is a wait list for iOS devices as it needs to be approved by iTunes.( Which will happen very shortly).
My referral link is below which will bring you to the Google store where you can download game. Once you have played a little and build your Head quarters ot will give me a green key for referring you and yourself a green key for being a referee (1 green key is 10 blue keys). 
Anyways the game is amazing and I've walked and biked around more than I have in a long time. (Can also drive around) I'm hooked and I'm sure you will be too after a couple days of playing.
