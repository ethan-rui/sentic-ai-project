21,pynip3,2021-09-30,Wall_street_retard,Steel futures continue to rise amid tight market,"All credit goes to u/vitocorlene, not posting on his behalf, just felt it was good information 

Chinese rebar and hot rolled coil futures continued to rise on Tuesday, as more provinces are reducing steel production through power shortages, while pre-holiday restocking supported demand, Kallanish notes.

On the Shanghai Futures Exchange the January 2022 rebar contract closed CNY 70/tonne higher than Friday at CNY 5,634/t ($872/t), and the same contract for HRC closed up CNY 79/t at CNY 5,671/t.
Fujian has launched production reduction measures at steelmakers in the province (see separate article). Hegang Xuangang in Hebei has meanwhile suspended production of all blast furnaces, with construction steel capacity of 350,000-400,00 tonnes/month.

Market participants speculate that production curbs during the Beijing Winter Olympics in February-March 2022 may be as strong as current ones, and that supply will remain tight for months. Some participants suggest steel companies within 100km of Beijing may have to be completely shut down",1
