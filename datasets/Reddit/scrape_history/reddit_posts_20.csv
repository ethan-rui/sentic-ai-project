9,pki3q1,2021-09-08,thegoodfight__,TWOH UPDATE: Another 8K filing today showing ANOTHER showed an institutional investor just took a bet it will hit .25/share by March 2022. Currently at .0032,"I first told you about TWOH last week when it was at .0024 and was coming off of great news (67% of debt eliminated and an institutional investor making a $200,000 best it would get to $.25/share). TWOH ran to .0041 over the next two trading sessions, and now is consolidating in the low .003s.

Well...another 8K filing dropped today, with another institutional investor giving a cash infusion at the same $.25/share valuation.

Wednesday, September 8th, another 8K: TWOH just got $100,000 cash in exchange for Series D shares that must be held for at least the next six months, i.e. TWOH gets a ton of cash and retail investors get no dilution until March of next year. WIN WIN

\- Read this 8K in conjunction with the September 1st 8K authorizing the restricted Series D from within the already approved AS count. The restricted stock cannot be converted for at least SIX months FROM the date on which the restricted shares are granted - These shares were issued at the same valuation as last week's 8K. These 4,000 Series D will convert to 400,000 common stock in exchange for $100,000, which places a value of $.25/share

\- This has a dual positive effect: (1) it increases the company core cash position and improves the balance sheet, and (2) it signals confidence by those who are close to the company that the company's value is expected to increase

Is it sinking in yet? 

In the past week, TWOH has announced:  

1. The largest note has been paid off. 67% of all debt is gone, equivalent to about $160,000.  One note remains (about $80,000), and that'll be gone soon as well. Management said so in the PR. 

2. a $200,000 cash infusion last week in exchange for Series D, i.e. NO dilutive effect. 

3. a $100,000 cash infusion this week in exchange for Series D, i.e. NO dilutive effect.  

When the third quarter 10Q comes out in mid-November, the numbers might be mind-boggling.  $240,000 in debt will be wiped off the books, and $300,000 in free cash flow will flow onto the books.  This doesn't even account for revenues! My conviction in TWOH just keeps growing stronger.
