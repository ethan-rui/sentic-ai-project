\--------------

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M.  Shares have been up 8-10% after hours.  I personally can't remember the last time BB had a revenue beat.

**Customer wins:**

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance it closes/gets announced this quarter (before year end)

**IVY + Amazon (IoT and the Connected Car):**

AUTO IVY will be available October 2021 Beta much sooner than expected and will have embedded battery efficiency and Payment platform Apps

**PAPA Chen delivering on QNX software in 24/25 of the leading OEM car companies**

**BlackBerry hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry's cyber security business unit:**

**Chart looks like a ""Gap and Go"" short squeeze in the short term, and over the medium term we have the Facebook patent sale/partnership news catalyst coming before the end of the year.**

I understand the obvious importance of the s&amp;p500 I fully agree with the need for hearing how the NASDAQ is doing, what I don‚Äôt get is how an index of 30 companies regardless of sector that is priced by such an inefficient method is seen as anywhere near the importance of the s&amp;p or the nasdaq.

Please enlighten me because if there‚Äôs a reason I should care I honestly would love to hear it I just can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs relevant to the level of being next to the other two large indexes.",46

&amp;#x200B;

* SOFI mentions soared today after the stock price provided solid returns to shareholders today, up 11% for the day.
* SDC momentum is carrying over from the last couple weeks. This seems to be the next ""short-squeeze"" stock you folks like.
* BB took off after-hours and was up 11% at one point, but is now up 6%.
* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

Here's the data of ticker mentions throughout the day, visualized. We can see the exact moment BB took off after-hours and when SOFI reall started to pick up momentum.

You all are ruthless! Another great day; another grind forward on **+21%** with umm.. half the volume (6.3mm) as yesterday.

**Let's talk price action**

Gapped open slightly from $15.27 to $15.50 with an immediate dump. I mean, wow... these clowns are running out of material. 

Quick snap back up and a grind upwards on moderate volume. Tested some resistance and broke through ($16.20, $16.80) but trend broke down after $17.15 and consolidated on buying exhaustion. Volume on the day at this point was like 2.5mm, maybe?? SPIR wasn't even trading every minute due to low volume. So most folks probably walked away, made some lunch, thought ""if we don't get volume, this is dead"", blah blah blah...

STOP... (this is important)

...because this is the exact point that the scales tipped bullish. The bullish price action was NOT the first part of the day, it was the boring middle because... **liquidity**... it doesn't exist. SPIR is a slip-and-slide. Low volume lubed the slide and caught MMs with their pants down dialing back IV (making calls cheaper). This is a game and this is when the bull strikes.

Volume started coming in at 2:45pm ET and the stage was set. Price went parabolic, up to ATH $19.50 then consolidated to finish the day; bringing $17.5 strikes ITM and rejecting the $20 strikes.

After hours... nothing. No volume, no buying or selling (price is irrelevant right now). No margin calls and no liquidations. Shorts are chilling.

**Tomorrow**

Tomorrow, we look for a gap open or simply price stability into open. We want to see CTB, SI, and age of loan to stay consistent. We want to see the option chain building, particularly in the $15 - $25 range. Ideally, tomorrow we'd like to see price finish above $20 - $25. Mostly because some dude said he‚Äôd kiss my penis if it did. Anyways, take a shower you nervous, sweaty bastards and I'll see you bright and early.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 22, 2021**

The market bounced today, breaking on the year‚Äôs longest streak of underperformance as Evergrande fears in the US ease and market participants digest commentary from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs September monetary policy meeting, which indicated the central bank will likely start tapering the pace of quantitative easing in the ‚Äúcoming meetings‚Äù and telegraphed interest rate hikes six or seven times by the end of 2024. As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed begins raising the interest rate sometime in the coming 1-2 years. Glad to see the market avoid a taper tantrum today. 

([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)). 

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has previously communicated to the market that the timing of a so-called taper ‚Äúwill not be intended to carry a direct signal‚Äù on the timing of eventual rate hikes. 

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. But Fed officials have said in recent weeks that by the end of the year, the economy will likely make the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress‚Äù indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

The Fed signaled, ‚ÄúParticipants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate‚Äù. 

In other news, during remarks following the release of the the meeting, Powell promised to make changes to the central bank‚Äôs rules on members trading securities. e added that he was not aware of the controversial trades made by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in 2020 prior to media reports over the past month.

‚ÄúWe understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that‚Äôs why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAn investment in knowledge pays the best interest.‚Äù - Benjamin Franklin",31
