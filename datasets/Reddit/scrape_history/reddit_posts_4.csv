The chart has spoken, we have defiled and devirginized that BLUE line which has ruled this ticker for since December. Let it be known that we have conquered, for now, and we may have squeezed a little but who knows where the price action will take us. Each one of you should have your own plans on when to add, lighten, sell or to diamond-hand. Each and everyone should follow their own respective plans, when to add, buy, lighten, sell or to diamond-hand. Congrats to everyone who made money.

5,puwl1v,2021-09-25,Zeuszoos,TradeStation Users: Q's Please?,"Hi,

Thank you all in advance for your time.

I am considering trying out TS (TradeStation) and I just have a few questions, if some TS users would please take a few moments by answering them for me.  I would greatly appreciate it!

1) How long have you been with TradeStation?

2) Why did you open an account with them?

3) For those with less than $50K in your TS account, are you able to look at upcoming IPO's?

4) How do you like TS?  How is the User Friendliness?

5) Have you tried their app out (Android or iOS?)?

6) Is there anything that people commonly do with these accounts, that TS doesn't do?  For example, I sometimes do OTC trades.  Do they allow OTC trades on TS?  Anything they don't?

7) Would you rate TS as better or worse than brokers like (for example) E*Trade or Fidelity?

Please use my numbering, so I'll know which parts of your answers go with which questions?

Thank all of you who respond again for your time!  I sincerely really do appreciate it!!!

10,puqsvl,2021-09-24,MarketMastered,CHWY is ready to rock,"Chwy is about to bounce harder than a tennis ball off the ground if it was thrown by someone athletic and not me. This underdog has had it's nose rubbed in the mess by news that ultimately doesn't matter based off supply chain worries and a bad seasonal earning from the economy reopening, but, it's so primed. 

In my link you will see a weekly chart, most of you probably don't know those exist, yes charts exist that aren't made on crayon an construction paper and they exist higher than the 1 minute. See that red pattern I drew? That's a wedge, wedges act like ramps for price, it tried to break beneath it and failed, notice where that wedge is? That's the vwap, volume weighted average price, for the entire decade! Since IPO the average price paid is 65.55, what does that mean? It means this stock is now on mega discount compared to highs, it is 2 standard deviations to the downside on the quarterly and that means any hedgefund or bank that has a trading desk has some poor schlub who had to stamp it as a buy on the price alone.   Price target is the 85-90$ range within a month.

tl;dr dog puns, must buy if like money, January calls or stock if you're boring. Price target 85-90$ range.

17,pulx56,2021-09-24,Wall_street_retard,"According to a recent poll from Pew Research, 93% of Americans are concerned about inflation, yet the market doesn‚Äôt reflect it. There‚Äôs a massive opportunity once retail discovers inflation hedges","
Out of the way. If you‚Äôre one of the 7% who is gonna start raging that inflation isn‚Äôt real, this should keep you distracted https://youtu.be/wV3N-wCRL2k

Now that the adults are in the room. Let‚Äôs talk inflation 

At the moment, 93% of Americans believe inflation is a serious issue. The 7% who don‚Äôt tend to be the modern monetary theorists in charge of our banks and hedge funds, who insist it‚Äôs all transitory 

Because of this mistaken belief. Inflation hedges such as commodities, gold, or bond shorts, are doing very poorly. As the 7% with the most money firmly believe inflation is transitory 

To Better illustrate, I‚Äôll go with the stock I know the most about, $CLF

$CLF is currently trading with a forward P/E of 4 at $20 a share. This share price is roughly pricing in HRC at $600 a ton. The market, due to inflation, currently has HRC at $1900 a ton. Just by simple math, CLF is worth $60 a share, more if you begin factoring in that there‚Äôs no reason to believe inflation is done

The crazy thing. This isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion. 93% of people agree. Once Americans learn how to properly hedge their investments for inflation, we will see a massive rally in all of these sectors",1
18,puq110,2021-09-24,Blurgsalsa,Failing to understand $AGTC,"Ok,  before you look at my bonkers reddit schtuff, let me just tell you- I'm a real dude, trying to grow and learn and figure this stuff out and I'm just hoping someone can explain this to me like I am 5.

Because this is truly bonkers to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

AGTC has steadily been going down for most of 2021.  I don't understand this.  If you look into the history there are multiple buy signals on this stock.  Yet it keeps going down.

In fact- NO SOURCE SAYS TO HOLD AND NO SOURCE SAYS TO SELL.  Yet it keeps going down.  

Now before you guys just absently dismiss this- recognize there is even MORE to this.

They have built a stellar team.  They have bought a huge wear house right next to them so they can develop their own drugs in house AND THEY HAVE ENOUGH CASH ON HAND THAT IF THEY DIDN'T DO FREAKING ANYTHING THEY COULD SURVIVE FOR TWO MORE YEARS.

But still the price goes down.

This past earnings call BLEW through earnings.  And they even displayed on their medical research that they have figured out ""max"" dose.  

YET STILL THE PRICE GOES DOWN?

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this?  Why are more people not seeing this?  Is this a shorting tactic?  Am I a fool for believing in this?  WHAT IS GOING ON here?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help with this would be huge.

Thank you!!",1
