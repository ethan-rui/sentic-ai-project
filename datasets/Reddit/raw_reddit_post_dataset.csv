2,ptpq2s,1632380766.0,jkktwg6,Namejamie,CLF IS STILL RED HOT,"CLF or Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest flat rolled steel producer in NA and in this piece I am gonna make the case that there could be room for a 10-20% upwards movement in the next 2 weeks. NO GAMMA OR SHORT SQUEEZE!

**BULL CASE:**

1. Steel still trading near ATH! Not much explanation is needed here.
2. **Infrastructure Bill**, I think, will pass in the next 2 weeks. **Now 2 things**, first is this belief is based on the fact that if the infrastructure bill fails I don't think Biden will get reelected which is a big no-no for the dems atm. I also think it is why you literally had Biden group together the dems yesterday to help figure their shit out. (They are making a massive push to get this \*\*\*\* through) Second of all, the infrastructure bill really doesn't help CLF that much BUTTTT, it will give massive momentum to the steel industry overall, just like how **SPCE** did an **8%** day last week right after **SpaceX's** recent launch even tho it didn't really help their company.
3. **BEST POINT I THINK**

In the last year, we have had **2 massive dips of 20%** or more. Both these dips have been followed by **new ATHs**. Once, in **FEB 24-26** and the other more recently in **July 12-19**.

**ANd** just like in both those dips we are seeing CLF find its floor and then rebound as people realize the sell-off is irrational. Drops in the IRON ORE price don't really hurt CLF and they are still trading at **ONLY 3x earnings** which is crazy cheap IMO.

4) They are printtttttttttttttttttting cash just like our **LORD AND SAVIOR JPOW** and they are using it first to massively pay down their debt which is good and then they will return that to shareholders which is the primary reason I think this stock will go into the 30s Q2 of next year.

**BEAR CASE:**

1. Iron ore continues to drop in price. Now while this won't affect CLF too much since they are vertically integrated and produce their own iron ore. In general, it hits the steel stocks hard in terms of the overall price and could continue to plague the stock.
2. Economic activity for whatever reason slows down. We already saw China say they were gonna make moves to slow GDP or at least not pursue growth at all costs and so on. This in turn would drop steel demand, which would be bad for CLF. The good news is GDP for America and China is still really high in general compared to historical numbers so not super worried there either.
3. IDK massive gbear black swan event?

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Infrastructure bill + irrational 20% sell-off will lead to a 10-20% upward movement in the next 2 weeks.

Magnet Forensics has been recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Canada by Canadian Business‚Äôs Growth 500 List in 2016, 2017 and 2019. They completed their IPO on the Toronto stock exchange earlier this year and used some of the proceeds to acquire DME forensics, a leading video and multimedia evidence company.

Digital Forensics Analysis is one of the fastest growing fields of technology and Magnet forensics has partnered with several law enforcement agencies world wide.

Magnet Forensics is associated with many previous Research in Motion employees (The original Blackberry) [https://www.magnetforensics.com/our-team/](https://www.magnetforensics.com/our-team/)

Major factors that are augmenting the growth of the market include the rising incidences of cybercrime, the huge growth of WFH (Work From Home) and the extensive usage of IoT devices. 

Contributing factors for share price increase are a small float and a large percentage of institutional ownership. Pretty much any positive news or positive guidance will result in the share price rising. 

Here are some of the highlights from their most recent earnings. (Source Yahoo Finance)

* Revenue of $16.5 million, an increase of 42% compared to $11.6 million, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in term license revenue and a $2.7 million increase in software maintenance and support revenue as a result of growth within the Company‚Äôs customer base, partially offset by a decrease in perpetual license revenue. The transition to a greater proportion of term license revenue compared to perpetual license revenue is part of the Company‚Äôs strategy to increase term license contracts. Total Recurring Revenue(1) was $13.3 million, representing 81% of total revenue.
* Annual Recurring Revenue(2) grew to $49.6 million, an increase of 48% compared to $33.5 million.
* **Gross Margin was 94%, compared to 95%, consistent with the prior period.**
* Net Income was $1.6 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to $2.9 million. The change is primarily due to the benefit of $1.5 million in assistance received under certain government programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior period as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses related to the IPO in 2021, which were partially offset by increased gross profit.
* Adjusted EBITDA1 was $4.4 million, unchanged from the prior period.
* Cash of $108.8 million, compared to $21.2 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $87.6 million, as a result of the net proceeds from its initial public offering (""IPO"") during the quarter.
* The Company‚Äôs approach of consistent and rapid innovation supported multiple software releases during the quarter, including version 5.0 of its flagship Magnet AXIOM product for public safety continued, the launch of its Magnet Digital Investigation Suite and new releases of its Magnet AXIOM Cyber for private enterprises.
* The Company announced a collaboration with London‚Äôs Metropolitan Police and Microsoft Azure to transform how police agencies investigate crimes with relevant digital evidence from smartphones and computers with the adoption of Magnet REVIEW. Users will be able to leverage REVIEW‚Äôs analytical tools to identify and report on critical evidence in a timely manner. REVIEW allows investigators to collaborate with technical personnel in the digital forensic lab and other units remotely, in a secure fashion, while maintaining the forensic integrity of the evidence.
* The Company won new customers across each of its public safety and private enterprise markets, including Europe, Asia, and North America.
* The Company expanded its accounts with key public and private sector customers that drove increased revenue as customers expanded their adoption of the Company‚Äôs software solutions.

10,ptn7wp,1632370063.0,4wjs17yo,Merkel420,SPY: The September yeet and October skeet ‚Äî outlook for broad US market (Squeezemetrics-based analysis),"Sorry for the text wall, I will keep it brief. The selloff has concluded, the FOMC fired a blank on Taper Roulette, market makers have plenty of liquidity after a harsh OpEx, and DIX has plenty of room for growth. We also bounced off a strong SPX support and FAANG stocks are at stable short term levels. I hope you shorted VXX cause we‚Äôre about to mainline a pure dose of dealer liquidity into our economy.

I expect a FCG or a gap up to 443 by Friday the 24th but it could on Monday because of FUD by dark buyers. From there we will see GEX dealers slow down their spending a bit (expect a bit of hesitation in the market midweek next week) and give DIX dark buyers more control over the price volatility as sentiment continues to get bullish and more non-dealer $$ is put into the market. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see SPY hit 450 by October 4th. But then vanna & charm start to kick in and price gets more volatile as DIX buyers leave the market and liquidity dries up. However, because of the recent dip, GEX dealers will have to spend more of their liquidity to regain control of the market prices‚Äô volatility from the dark pool (who has widened the bid/ask, which the dealers will fill). Btw the big crash will come when the dark pool has control of price volatility and GEX dealers have run out of liquidity; I think we‚Äôll set a new ATH in December, double top in January 22, and then crash like crash down to sub-400 levels on SPY.

There are major announcements in early October so a dip catalyst will be either news or time spent on resistance levels (which is why I think the dip will be delayed until late in the 2nd week of October i.e 6-8th). Whenever the market is on the edge of some weird shit like not reaching a new ATH, meme stocks and weed stocks seem to pop so expect that anytime between the 27th and 8th on all your favorites meme tickers.

Keep in mind with SqueezeMetrics: You never want DIX to be crossed on the way up! GEX rising above DIX will stagnate price growth a lot b/c MM has control of the liquidity. If this happens, be weary.

 

TLDR; no more dipping in September, SPY 441 tomorrow, SPY 445 by next Friday, SPY 450 by October 4. All meme stocks and weed stocks to yeet to varying levels in the next 2 weeks. Prepare for another big market dip to start around Oct 6-8th-ish and expect it to end on Oct. 18th-19th.

 

***Keep in mind if we set new all time highs right away or hold this level on the indices, all of this is fucked. Either all of it happens or none of it does. If any of this seems like legitimate legal financial advice to you, get a loaded shotgun and a metal hat to keep the ceiling clean. Any feedback is welcome!

I‚Äôm building an absolute monster position and the last week has been great for adding.

**Goal**:

100k shares

**Currently**:

Circa 75k shares between four accounts

**Why do I Like the Stock?**

From a Macro view industries have been getting disrupted with tech for awhile, insurance is next. At its heart Root is an Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and a future high cash flow generating monster. Everyone legally needs insurance and the Total Addressable Market is massive. Insurance industry is circa $4 trillion, while the USA Auto industry is $288bn annually. Discrimination against insurers is real, remember when your were a kid and paid 100's of % more than your parents? Good drivers should pay low rates, bad driver pay high rates. Age, degree, skin color, health condition aside. Just like Smokers should pay more for health care and so on...

With regards to all this data they are collecting? Well Facebook always said they would not monetize the data, but you know the story.. they did. Can Root monetize the data they are collecting? Yes for sure on internal optimization but what can they do externally? Partners products like financing, etc.? Will they? We will see, I'm betting yes.

I'm 33, for consumer acquisition I'm a mix of people and apps. For insurance, I haven't been to the broker for awhile but deal in email, however, some of the apps recently they are so damn good and so easy to use I would much prefer that. The days of calling or going to a brokers is over. Soon this will be the norm.

The culture at Root looks amazing, they care about the people and provide a nice work environment. I've done some research on LinkedIn and many have left All State, State Farm, etc. to go to Root. This is telling, IMO.

Lastly, a story that really hit home was Warren Buffet and Geico. His biggest regret was not buying it sooner. While I'm not saying Root is Geico and I'm not Buffet, I'm just doing what works best. Learn from others mistakes not your own. Buffet fully acquired Geico in the 90's for \~3.5bn its now valued over $50bn, enough said!

**I've Seen The Negative Comments:**

Companies face growing pains and Root is not immune to this. By replacing the Chief Technology Officer and recently moving the Chief Financial Officer to essentially head of Company Growth I see this as very bullish signals that they are adjusting and correcting course. Can they get by without removing Alex Timms? We will find out shortly.

I'm thinking Embedded Insurance, future insurance products priced on use and the sheer expansion across the USA will send G$ROOT to the moon!

Stock is extremely undervalued. Last round of funding before the IPO was for \~$15 and IPO at \~$27.

This could squeeze which would be great but I'm buying because of the undervalued aspect and disruption to a multi-trillion dollar industry.

**Finally Price Target:**

Realistically I don‚Äôt see why this isn‚Äôt back to $27+ it‚Äôs IPO price. With a higher valuation multiple like Lemonade even $50, 60+. It‚Äôs even scooped additional partnerships with Carvana and more in discussion with financial institutions. If it can squeeze then even higher. Root has a Billion of Cash on hand. They are burning through cash every quarter.

Carvana increased its gross profit per car from $1k to $4k by vertically integrating. 80% of Carvana customers take them up on their internal financing offering. Cantor Fitzgerald predicts 40% of customers will take Root up which is 38k Policies initially making its way up to 338k policies in a couple years. The average Root policy is around $1k. Carvana has options for 5% to 33% ownership of Root.

Have you checked out Carvana Market Cap Growth? Currently $27bn MC with 2800% growth in last 5 years. I think they know what they are doing when they invest $126m into Root.

**Short Squeeze: BONUS. BIG MONEY BIG MONEY. LMAO**

I‚Äôm not here for the squeeze I‚Äôm here because it‚Äôs criminally undervalued and the growth opportunity is wild.

Short Interest is 30%+, borrowing rate is growing. Around 22m shares short.

Technical Analysis shows imminent bounces to $14+ after imminently breaking out of the current descending wedge.

**Catalysts**:

Official Carvana ER guidance, New states sales increases, RootReady and embedded insurance, More insurance products driven by tech.

**Positions or ban:**

Four accounts with a total of 74,150 shares, \~70% of my liquid investments. Out of a possible 742 calls I have about 200 calls out. Need to keep some income coming in for more shares! If it squeezes I've got over 50k shares free of any covered calls. Will be buying some cheap OTM calls to protect my covered calls and those gains.

Currently selling way OTM covered calls to generate some income for buying more shares.

Dec 17 added 30, 35 strike, as if this isn‚Äôt a good sign!

BRING ON THE REST OF THE POST.

Previous Post: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5dzl9/return_of_big_oil_the_death_of_oil_has_been/

First off TLDR: XOM calls 1/22/22 $70-$80 and OXY 1/22/23 calls $40.

UK in the past week has shown what happens when you do not have a steady supply of LNG.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Gas-Crunch-Threatens-UK-Energy-Industry-With-Wave-Of-Bankruptcies.html

Currently, BOFA just announced that if we have colder than normal winter that the UK plants will switch from LNG to Oil which is literally bonkers. Based on their analysis oil would get to $100 in Q1 2022 and gas would run to $10 per gas.

While I love reading what if scenarios, lets talk about the current supply and demand situation. Today, the EIA posted details about where we currently sit. (picture) As you can tell by reading numbers we are decreasing in storage in crude oil. Put simply we now are 20 million barrels away from the most bullish outlook that BOFA is speculating on for Q4 21 - Q1 22. In case you really want to dive in deeper here is a direct link to the EIA article posted about the Cushing storage in OK. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49636

Put plainly, the reason I say that we are 20MMBO, (currently at 32.9 MMBO in storage), away from extremely bullish scenarios is that the graph through that link shows the storage levels from 2012-2021. This reduction would put the total around the 2014-2015 inventory level. (Roughly around 19MMBO in storage). The last time we hit this level of storage decline we saw in June was back in 1981 when the EIA started collecting data. Back during that time the price of oil increased from $94 per BO to $105 at the peak of low in storage. Currently at our pace of use due to exporting barrels and consumption I would roughly guess that we begin to have a ""crisis"" after the US E&P operators report Q3 earnings.

Last time I spoke on this, I was posting information about the Rig count and drilled inventory (drilled but uncompleted wells) and true to that post the Rig Count has only slightly increased and the drilled count has reduced significantly. Meaning, if operators would like to keep the current production flat and return capital to shareholders we should begin seeing more rigs get added and the drilled count flatten.

Now on to the fun stuff. Remember this is the musings of a madlad.

Hurricane Ida should have been a simple hurricane with little to no real damage to the offshore production and refining capacity. However, Shell has already stated that they are at 60% Gulf of Mexico production and it will not return to 100% until Q1 2022. Alongside this was the amount of barrels that were offline for 2-3 weeks outpaced 2-3 months of OPEC+ increases in BO supplied to the market. Thus, we are in a deficit of supply and we should see decreasing inventories over the next couple of months. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49576

Finally, in regards to the elephant in the room, OPEC+. They continue to state that OPEC+ has the capacity to produce significantly higher barrels of oil. Please read this beasts post about how they don't have that capacity. https://twitter.com/BisonInterests/status/1440308387292475393

So lets combine the 3 criteria that I have listed in short hand.

Low US crude 2. Shut off production 3. Falsified OPEC+ true max production Just like a steamroller coming head on we can see the impending issues but for some reason we can move out of the way. (Austin powers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k)

Implied demand for oil is returning to the 2019 values and will continue to increase as we gear up for the upcoming holiday season. Not only will the vaccine induced holiday demand we saw over the summer continue but I would expect it to increase further.

All of the above market/macro information is required to understand the current energy market. While earlier in the year I was confident that this was going to happen sooner life just doesn't work that way. Right now, we have a couple companies that I think are undervalued and worth taking a look at:

OXY calls 1/22/23 $40 XOM calls 1/22/22 $65 CPE calls 1/22/23 $45 Each are a little different and currently I am still up in the air about the 3rd option. But its worth mentioning.

Starting with OXY, it is a very simple story of debt reduction, execution and FCF. OXY in this environment of $72 oil and $4.80 gas literally can paydown a couple billion dollars every quarter. Currently this year they have reduced debt by $3.0 Billion and $1.5 billion of extending debt further into the future. I do not like the management but the assets they own are incredible. Recently, the wells they turned online are outperforming their expectations (something they should highlight) by 20%. Essentially these well are making what other wells make in 8-10 months in 3-4 months. As long as they keep paying down debt and holding production flat they will payout more than almost any other company. (maybe the new ConocoPhillips will give them a run for their money). XOM is turning online their lowest cost barrels in both the Permian Basin and Guyana. In fact, they have found additionally pay zones that makes Guyana in development until the 2030's. That oil works at 38-45 per BO. Not to mention that they sell barrels around the world at Brent pricing. ($2-$3 per BO higher.) Last quarter they highlighted their refinery's making a significant amount of money but using a large portion for upgrades. But we should expect that they are the largest US E&P to return to form. Expectation is that post Q3 report we get debt reduction, increase in dividend (6.4% annually), and production increase. CPE. Honorable mention because they have 22% short interest and are a terrible company that needs $70 oil and $4 gas to survive. Surprisingly enough that's where we are at. Maybe they make it maybe they dont. Great news for you is that these companies can also be bought with shares for the sweet sweet dividend. That's nice too. Oh and inflation means that real assets do pretty well. If we keep inflation high expect these motherfuckers to run even higher.

Good luck to you all and may the barrels flow in your favor.",34,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2887073a0>

My favorite company is $QS. It‚Äôs a hated company around here, mostly because people have been burned. It doesn‚Äôt matter who YOUR FAVORITE is; however, you have the right to do what you can to protect your position.

If you‚Äôre fed up and want to better protect your position consider the following: Stop selling covered calls, short sellers buy out-of-the money calls to cover their risk. Stop buying out of the money calls speculatively and then selling them to short sellers. Stop getting frightened away and selling your shares for LESS THAN you‚Äôre ACTUALLY willing to receive for them.

Most importantly, make sure YOUR SHARES are not available for shorting. I‚Äôll post an article below.

As for me and my QS shares, they are not for sell for less than $100 / share / year of operation over the next five years.

Thank you, and please protect your company and share, as well, based upon your honest sense of value for the company.",3,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x288746d00>

This 27 dollar stock going to 40 FAST?,"Corsair Gaming, Inc. is a leading global developer and manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for gamers, content creators, and PC enthusiasts. This is a market that is only expected to keep growing! CRSR just started getting in to the camera business. As you and I know, streaming is a growing business and CRSR is a dominant player taking marketshare from competitors. 

\-Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening!

\-Zacks Consensus Estimates expect earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $2.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.75% and +22.19%, respectively, from last year.

\-Digging into valuation, CRSR currently has a Forward P/E ratio of around 15. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.03.

\-CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share.

\-CRSR has also commited to paying down its debt strengthening its balance sheet.

\-The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021.

Since this stock has been beaten down lately, this is a great entry point in my opinion. Not financial advice I'm just an ape. I have 6500 shares at 27.70 per share.

I received a paper check for $814, representing 0.0000125% of the $65M settlement. 

[Financial Fair Fund](https://www.robinhoodfinancialfairfund.com/faq)

What is this about?:
On December 17, 2020, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (‚ÄúRobinhood Order‚Äù)  against Robinhood, finding that the Respondent violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4 thereunder.  The matter involves material misrepresentations and omissions by Robinhood relating to its revenue sources, specifically its receipt of payments from certain principal trading firms, also known as electronic market makers, for routing Robinhood customer orders to them, and relating to certain statements about the execution quality Robinhood achieved for its customers‚Äô orders, and Robinhood‚Äôs failure to satisfy its duty of best execution for those orders.

The Robinhood Order required Robinhood to pay a civil money penalty of $65,000,000.00, and created a Fair Fund, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, so the penalty could be distributed to harmed investors (the ‚ÄúRobinhood Fair Fund‚Äù or ‚ÄúFair Fund‚Äù).

Who is eligible?:
Any individual or entity, or their lawful successors, who traded with Robinhood Financial, LLC, during the period from the July 1, 2016  to June 30, 2019, who is not an Excluded Party, and who is determined by the Fund Administrator to be eligible for a distribution under the Approved Plan.

How will distribution payments be calculated?:
Using information collected by the Commission staff during the investigation, the distributable amount for each Eligible Investor is calculated as the harm suffered by each Eligible Investor due to negatively affected execution prices.",13,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28888e970>

This opportunity is like buying $AMD sub $2 before SU BAE took the stock to $100!  üòç

\--------------

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M.  Shares have been up 8-10% after hours.  I personally can't remember the last time BlackBerry had a revenue beat.

**Customer wins:**

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BlackBerry Protect & Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance the rest gets closed/announced before the end of this quarter (before year end)

What‚Äôs interesting is that he said he‚Äôs got other buyers lined up and that the current company (or companies) had exclusive negotiating rights

With billions being thrown around in this space, he‚Äôs going to get a VERY good price for his IP (Intellectual Property)/licensing

This is awesome!

**IVY + Amazon (IoT and the Connected Car):**

IVY Beta will be available October 2021 which is much sooner than expected and will have embedded battery efficiency and Payment platform Apps

**PAPA Chen delivering on QNX software in 24/25 of the leading OEM EV car companies (lol i'm assuming the last one is Telsa? partnership incoming?):**

* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

You all are ruthless! Another great day; another grind forward on **+21%** with umm.. half the volume (6.3mm) as yesterday.

**Let's talk price action**

Gapped open slightly from $15.27 to $15.50 with an immediate dump. I mean, wow... these clowns are running out of material. 

Quick snap back up and a grind upwards on moderate volume. Tested some resistance and broke through ($16.20, $16.80) but trend broke down after $17.15 and consolidated on buying exhaustion. Volume on the day at this point was like 2.5mm, maybe?? SPIR wasn't even trading every minute due to low volume. So most folks probably walked away, made some lunch, thought ""if we don't get volume, this is dead"", blah blah blah...

STOP... (this is important)

...because this is the exact point that the scales tipped bullish. The bullish price action was NOT the first part of the day, it was the boring middle because... **liquidity**... it doesn't exist. SPIR is a slip-and-slide. Low volume lubed the slide and caught MMs with their pants down dialing back IV (making calls cheaper). This is a game and this is when the bull strikes.

Volume started coming in at 2:45pm ET and the stage was set. Price went parabolic, up to ATH $19.50 then consolidated to finish the day; bringing $17.5 strikes ITM and rejecting the $20 strikes.

After hours... nothing. No volume, no buying or selling (price is irrelevant right now). No margin calls and no liquidations. Shorts are chilling.

**Tomorrow**

Tomorrow, we look for a gap open or simply price stability into open. We want to see CTB, SI, and age of loan to stay consistent. We want to see the option chain building, particularly in the $15 - $25 range. Ideally, tomorrow we'd like to see price finish above $20 - $25.

The response was overwhelmingly positive.  We had a discussion amongst us mods at the time to see if it would be something.  We always kept crypto out of /r/wallstreetbets because it just isn't what this community is about. With so many people trading crypto now, times have changed and crypto does seem to belong here.  Going into this there was opposition against it and while there were valid points to both sides it's not easy to change someone's mind who stands a hard line. After taking it all into consideration I decided to go ahead find a way to allow at least some discussion about it, some were excited about it and it was suggested it should be in limited form. Less than ideal but it was a start.

Our community has gone through a lot of growth.  For some of those who have been here a while, you might find yourself lost in the sea of chatter from our new membership. We were all once new at some point and shortly we learned to understand the culture.  We are individuals from all walks of life. From lawyers, doctors, stay-at-home moms to college students.  One thing we have in common is Win or lose, we are unapologetic about our ambition to make some gains by speculating on the stock market or love to see others do it.

So as we sit here on September 22, 2021, while your portfolios recover or as you sit and watch your spy puts get melted,  we want to formally announce /r/wallstreetbetscrypto where you can do and see all you love that goes on here but on crypto.

One can see that there are a number of factors that stack up against the mortgage REIT. This reality has led some investors to bet against the stock, leaving 17.5% of its short being sold short.

But everybody knows now that when short interest gets higher, the likelihood of a Reddit tidal wave goes up. And of course, r/WallStreetBets is abuzz with IVR talk; mentions of IVR stock on the subreddit are up over 1,250% in 24 hours.

One poster drew up their deep dive into IVR and how the housing bubble will in fact aid mortgage REITs like IVR. The theory is up for debate, and only time will tell if Redditors or short sellers are correct. In the meantime, though, the retail trading legion is buying up shares of IVR stock, catalyzing a squeeze today.

IVR stock is up big in trading volume, seeing 129 million shares trading so far, as compared to a daily average of less than 7.5 million. The stock is up 21%.

I believe it has a long way to go. My main DD for holding (aside from the general points listed in my original post) are that the biggest concern for this stock was previously bank partner consolidation and poorly diversified customer acquisition. Over the past several months, UPST has shown a focus on these exact two things - adding multiple bank partners each month and building out creative partnerships to increase customer inflow for both personal and auto loans. 

Not only that, but there has been very large volume sell offs from insiders (small % of their holdings though) which has done close to nothing to bringing down the price. There seems to be huge appetite here. This is just the beginning for UPST and there is long runway left. Buy a ticket while you can!

[Guys I Discovered Options. TMC $10 CALL 10/15 $35K My College Savings. Pray For Me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp5zgl/guys_i_discovered_options_tmc_10_call_1015_35k_my/) (2k upvotes, 865 comments)

The main point people are pushing in these posts is that the 'public float' is only 2.7 million shares. However what these posts do not mention, is that there are **203 million DeepGreen shares of which 55% are immediately unlocked.** I'm not denying that at the moment the acquisition closed and the 8-K was released on **September 9th,** the float was 2.7 million. However there are \~100 million shares that have been eligible to be sold since then, so the **float has increased WAY BEYOND 2.7M SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE SPAC**. 

# DID YOU CHECK THE OP's CLAIMS BEFORE YOLOING?

The 2.7 million float thesis has been posted so much across WSB/Stocktwits/Twitter. So many times that everyone took it as fact. However this fact could be refuted with about 30 minutes of research on SEC EDGAR (free resource). If you paid for BamSEC ($35/month), you could have probably found the evidence refuting this in about 5 minutes.

Here's my thread on why the 2.7 million float was wrong, posted on **THURSDAY when the stock was at $12.34 (stock down \~45% since then).**

[Why are people lying about $TMC Float? Float is 100+ million, not 2.7 million LOL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppu3d1/why_are_people_lying_about_tmc_float_float_is_100/) (Negative 47 upvotes, 48 comments)

I haven't posted on WSB in 8 months but the pumping and lying about the float was so pathetic that I had to chime in. However people just called me retarded, so I loaded $5 puts.

# DEEP GREEN SHAREHOLDERS - DESPERATE TO SELL

I'm not going to go into the DD on the actual company. I think most here understand it's worth $0-$2 max and a squeeze based on 2.7 million float was the main thesis. DeepGreen shareholders understand this too and are clearly dumping the 55% of their shares that are unlocked. They are probably writing off their 6 month locked shares as worth $0. But they are still making bank because WSB and stocktwits are driving liquidity for them to dump.

# WSB DRIVES LIQUIDITY SO INSIDERS CAN DUMP

This company is such a fraud and valuation so ridiculous that several PIPE investors reneged on their commitments and would rather take their chances in court then fund this thing. DeepGreen shareholders know this and are desperate to get out. To get out at reasonably inflated prices they need liquidity or this thing will go to zero as they all dump. Que the hundreds of posts on WSB pumping this thing. Even the buyers today scooping up 'cheapies' at $7 will get smoked. DeepGreen shareholders are happy to sell something that is intrinsically worthless for $7. Heck they would be happy to dump their shares at $2 (and will be doing this in a few weeks I reckon).

# BUT BUT CEO CONFIRMED 2.7 MILLION FLOAT REEEE

No he fucking didn't. Watch the interview for yourself and don't just take someone's word for it. He was very very careful to say float is low (subjective) and not confirm the 2.7 million figure that reddit is pushing. Also this is a fraudulent Canadian underwated mining company with a fraudster CEO who wore a fucking **T-Shirt** to ring the bell of the NYSE last Friday. So the fact that you all didn't take what he said with a grain of salt is hilarious. 

# QUESTION EVERYTING (AND GET REAL)

It seems like every post on WSB now is ""Reeee if we all buy alot of shares price go up."" Zero sum games are not going to make WSB money in the aggregate. Hive mind behavior opens up WSB to be scammed like they were with $TMC. All it took for DeepGreen and other insiders to dump shares in this company worth $0 was a fake float number posted several times on WSB . The kicker is that the pump was most likely coordinated by the company itself. 

**To WSB's credit, it seems like most commenters understood the company was fraudulent and were only getting in on this for a squeeze play. However, if you know the company is fraudulent, maybe next time spend 15-30 minutes confirming if the 'float' supporting the squeeze play is actually accurate (SPOILER: IT WASN'T).**

Now, the big question is, what in the world will make this fly aside from the WHO approval? Well folks, the SHORT interest for this stock is currently at a whopping 28.67%. My best retarded guess is, shorts will have to start covering soon or else they will get torpedoed in the back once the EUA passes. Now, I honestly do not know much about options, so If anybody can take a look at it if theres a chance this company can gamma squeeze them shortsucks, post it in a separate DD. Interestingly enough, the PM  of India is currently on a plane-ride going to the USA to discuss security, economy and VACCINES; it has been speculated that Mr. Modi will push for Covaxin's EUA approval during his visit today. I wish i could have done a longer DD showing the efficacy rate of Covaxin, probable TAM as it could readily supply ASIA, especially the Southeast Asia region. Also, since this company is using an old school process of making the vaccines, it can have a market of its own in big countries such as USA, UK and Australia to name a few. Covaxin has already been disributed in India which has a population of 1.36 billion. At a market cap of 1.5 billion, a small percentage of the VERY HUGE addressable market in this Pandemic can send this stock to heaven, I think you guys know what I mean. I hope someone can add some more info on the comment section. I currently own 9.9k shares for now and will add another 10k on the day the EUA is announced. This is not financial advise, and this is somewhat a risky play. But risk vs reward is just so juicy that I cannot ignore what can happen once EUA is approved.

Simon Property Group owns mall properties and made a sexy comeback after covid so I'm here to give you some seriously juicy information about the stocks future here in the next coming months.

&#x200B;

One thing I've noticed is the sentiment around malls is that they have down syndrome and no one goes to them anymore.

You don't know what you have until it's gone.

Thanks to COVID everyone realized the mall is actually fun place to go hand out in air conditioning and shop at a Gamestop with a bubble tea.

The mall has been packed.

I am a small business owner, I own a ride and a business in a mall that is owned by SPG. I am going to give you some good information for you to read while your wife gets air tighted by not one but three men that are your better in every way, partly because they invest in SPG.

Yes there is a Gamestop in the mall I work in.

I am not putting in graphs or rocket ships BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT TURKEY TENDIES FOR BLACK FRIDAY AND HAM TENDIES FOR CHRISTMAS. HAM TENDERS!!! also because I assume the moderators are going to make this a bitch to post anyway but here it goes.

&#x200B;

Right now, September and October are the slowest months for malls. This won't effect the stock price in a negative fashion because we will still have to pay rent. Why does this matter for the next coming months?

I'll tell you why.

The mall charges all the stores more rent during November and December. This is perfect for a holiday stock buy because over the next 4 months you are going to see the price rise due to this and what's even better...

The stores have a natural break point attached to their rent agreements. This means if the store makes over a certain amount the mall gets a percentage of that.

This year is going to be huge.

The mall has been packed and I have been doing very well on both my companies. I pay SPG thousands of dollars for rent and it is going up a lot in November so I thought you all should know so all my money goes to your wife after the divorce.

Even though I jumped in late for the covid recovery I really like the stock and the dividends have kept me holding for many months.

&#x200B;

I am in with 99 shares 133ish average. (Fuck off I'm poor)

I will be holding until January.

**TLDR:** ARCB is super undervalued

**Industry:** Let's call it Integrated Freight & Logistics. Mostly known for being a trucking company, ArcBest has been transforming itself into an all-in-one integrated logistics company. 

Trucking & Logistics, especially globally is facing a few major headwinds right now. The biggest ones being [labor supply and capacity concerns](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/transportation-capacity-dips-further-prices-keep-surging). 

The labor shortage is mostly in long-haul but this is both good and bad for ARCB.

Why is it bad? Labor shortage leads to increased pay which decreases margins. ArcBests asset-based business makes up about 68% of revenues. I'd imagine that long haul trucking has probably had a labor shortage for a long time but maybe I'm wrong on that. Otherwise, asset-based revenues still growing 13% compared to 2019 so I'm not too worried.

Why is it good? It's good because their ArcBest supply chain-as-a-service component offers a full array of logistics solutions to optimize customers supply chains. I expect labor shortages to persist through 2022 and force more companies to turn to tech to optimize as much as possible. 

They have pricing power and demand is good so I expect the industry to out perform the market and ARCB to out perform the industry.

&#x200B;

**Financials:** 

For the comparisons I am including both Trucking and Integrated Freight & Logistics companies

I'm old school, I like a nice juicy price to sales ratio. So I throw a bunch of data in a sheet and sort by lowest price to sales. Take out anything less than 1B market cap because those micro caps make the data look weird sometimes. 

When looking at the industry ARCB is hilariously low. They have a .48 price to sales compare that to other similar companies like JBHT (1.66), WERN (1.27), SAIA (3.08). Sheesh that's cheap. 

What about P/E??? 12 compared to JBHT (33), WERN (16), SAIA (34). Looks pretty good to me.

Positive ROA and ROE, if anyone cares about those at all

EPS beat 4 times in a row. 

Their ArcBest supply chain-as-a-service solution grew 48% Q2 YoY compared to 2019 and 65% compared to 2020. This is their biggest area of opportunity imo and I expect explosive growth here that will drive the stock up.

Operating margins have increased steadily for the last 3 years add in sales growth and that's great for earnings. Earnings up = stock up

Throw in a small dividend for good measure

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

ARCB is a solid company with huge growth potential. It's super undervalued in an industry that I believe will out perform the market through this year and into 2022.",0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x289431fd0>

What a run so far on high redemption deSPACs! Along with the main runners from last week we have new soldiers joining the generals in the deSPAC wars. These tickers have been running even with the broader market tanking, wrecking the accounts of SPY bulls (including me REEEEE). While these plays are still ongoing, the IV has spiked enough in almost all these cases making the fabled multibaggers harder to come by.

I was searching for something that hasn't taken off yet and saw that every single [deSPAC with a redemption rate more than 70% since August](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pkw978/spac_redemption_rate_in_august)  has atleast had a 'pop' in the underlying and IV as people started to get familiar with this new meta for deSPACs and have began hunting for tickers with similar mechanics as the ones that soared before. Well everything except for one which seems to have gone under the radar, CZOO.  

# What is Cazoo?

Let me give a very quick overview of CZOO and why it could be a good long term hold at these levels (unlike many deSPACs running currently). All you deSPAC degens can safely skip this section. 

[CEO Alex Chesterman OBE, looks like a guy who knows what he is doing](https://preview.redd.it/x3a9v0m6k0p71.jpg?width=1390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a359fe74a709ca50268b0b288be7f947f296a94e)

Cazoo is a European online used car-seller. Similar to Carvana in the US.  Unlike Carvana and competitors, they also provide a subscription service for the same as well. Cazoo is mainly based in the UK and expanded to France and Germany. They are expanding aggressively across Europe and would also use the proceeds from the SPAC deal for the same. 

When the deal was struck many investors did not like it as they were expecting something sexy like an EV company as those was all the rage back then (we know now how those turned out). Especially since the SPAC was founded by billionaire investor Dan Och and had a stellar leadership. There were also many concerns regarding the valuation as the deal valued Cazoo at $7B. People failed to realize how transformative the pandemic has been to Cazoo's business.  Now that they have a $1B dollar warchest from the SPAC deal (trust + PIPE), they can aggressively go about crushing the competition taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. This cash they got from the deal is a moat that insulates them from competition as they rapidly expand and acquire new customers.

Looking back, this seems to be one of the few SPAC deals that have aged well. Since the deal was made, CVNA soared as much as 53% and is now 30% higher. This is in stark contrast to many SPAC deals, where the comps have gone down significantly (looking at you HIPO)

**What do analysts think?**

Cazoo is a recent deSPAC and it usually takes a while before analysts start coverage. However, Citigroup has already initiated coverage with a buy rating and a **PT of $11.8 which represents a 32%** upside from current levels.

# The technical setup:

CZOO completed the merger on Aug 27 and had 72.32% of the trust redeemed according to the [8-K filed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1824963/000121390021043739/ea146130-8k_ajax1.htm) by the SPAC. The trust had 80.5M shares leaving behind a tiny float of 22.3M shares. This is not as tiny as the IRNT, OPAD, TMC triad, but deSPACs with larger floats post redemption like DNA, NRDY, JOBY have had impressive runs already.

[Relevant section fom the 8-K regarding redemptions](https://preview.redd.it/7aquv06jr0p71.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=628034901b18453f365822a14d05d814de65282c)

The PIPE holders have \~80M shares which are under lockup currently. CZOO hasn't filed the S-1 yet so these shares won't hit the markets anytime soon. Once the S-1 is filed, it is followed by the 424B and then EFFECT following which the shares can sold.

Other deSPAC plays like AGIL, VLTA, XOS are on borrowed time as they have already filed S-1s. On average it takes about 21 days post S-1 till PIPE shares become registered. So these can go on till then. 

I couldn't find active discussions on CZOO in trading/investment subreddits so this seems undiscovered.

**Short interest:**

https://preview.redd.it/x12xbr1sj0p71.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5c1af2d03cd873d904d8a87cb06318799a8c08

The last exchange reported SI was 2.72M which is 12% of the float. This is based on the Aug 31st settlement date which falls after the merger and hence includes any change in SI post merger. Many people are unaware of this, but shorts are usually closed out at NAV incase of high redemption deSPACs so unless you have post merger exchange reported SI, the various SI tracking services get it wrong. Currently Ortex does not estimate the SI but reports the shares on loan at 5.16M. All  shares loaned out need not be shorted so the max SI according to Ortex would be 23% of the float.

In addition to this, the CTB has creeped up to 19% and the utilization is at 88.5% which means there is not a lot of ammo left to short this down. The days to cover is estimated to be 10.32 based on current volume.

  
**Price Action:**

The PA so far reminds me of how a deSPAC moves before it pops big. The fade on low volume after merger followed by the float up on low volume. 

[CZOO](https://preview.redd.it/hi95ckxag1p71.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d4279518ecad82d9e07a481df5b58e596a17b1)

This type of indecisive movement on low volume can found across multiple high redemption deSPACs. Let us consider the example of SPIR, one of the new favorites. It had been trading in the low volume zombie zone since the merger completion and once volume came in, BAM!! 

[SPIR. Sorry I had to make a yOu aRe hErE reference.](https://preview.redd.it/lj8ulgnbg1p71.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=939b86264be3d3c6174257cd9f0c99153dc5f405)

**Options:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/frhu3gnug1p71.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a0141f92ab4693daf4384a04700c2617a6565c

I noticed a curious spike in bullish call volume last week and early this week, which alerted me to the play. Here is the kicker, **CZOO options have one of the lowest IVs for a recent deSPAC with high redemptions**. MMs have ramped up IVs for most of the them to account for the low float deSPAC dynamics.

Here is a general comment on these plays since I know many of you got burned buying OTM FDs at nosebleed IV levels last week. Stop buying 500% IV OTM FDs tards! It may actually hurt the chances of a Gamma squeeze. Once MMs collect those juicy premiums from those way OTM calls, they would be able to offset some of the losses from the calls they wrote earlier and hence maybe to hedge less aggressively.

The ATM IV for Oct expiry for CZOO sits at \~97%.

Here is a comparison with other high redemption deSPACs (can't mention many because of low market cap):  

* TMC \~244%
* IRNT \~220%
* XOS \~163%
* OPAD \~159%
* SPIR \~142%
* VLTA \~125%
* CLBT \~118%

Undiscovered high redemption low float deSPAC + company that is not trash + low IV -> üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

The amount of people posting online saying $AMC is burning cash and going bankrupt is crazy, and none of them are doing the very simple math.

So lets walk through this 6th grade level math. $AMC is earning a total gross profit per attendee of $12.20 ($6.08 from ticketing and $6.13 from food/bev), that's pretty solid.

$AMC's total fixed costs going forward is going to be around $675 million a quarter (OpEx $310, Rent $210, G&A $55, Interest $100).

Divide $675 million by $12.20 gross margin per attendee and it takes 54 million attendees each quarter for $AMC to break even. 54 million attendees is 40-50% below what 2019 attendance levels were. Looking at the recent box office numbers July was 56% below 2019, and August was 51% below 2019.

WE ARE ALREADY AT BREAKEVEN LEVELS WITH HARDLY ANY NEW RELEASES! So no, even if $AMC doesnt sell new shares, they will not be going bankrupt.",29,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2895b7790>

Global oil demand has recently risen to near-record levels as global activity picks up steam despite the pandemic.

In response, OPEC+ agreed to increase oil production starting in August by another 400,000 bpd each month. But not all producers have responded to the call for more barrels.¬†

Angola, Nigeria, and Kazahkstan have been unable to lift their oil production to meet the call for more oil. In Kazakhstan's case, this was due to maintenance in its Tengiz field‚Äîmaintenance which ended mid-September. For Angola and Nigeria, years of underinvestment in their oil industry has rendered them unable to respond quickly to increased demand.

The current plan is for OPEC+ to [continue increasing production](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Prices-Climb-As-OPEC-Stands-Firm-On-Production-Plan.html) by another 400,000 bpd in October and another 400,000 bpd in November.

Two Reuters sources said on Tuesday that OPEC+'s compliance with the cuts [rose to 116%](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/OPEC-Boosts-Compliance-With-Oil-Production-Cuts-To-116.html) in August, excluding Mexico.

Meanwhile, U.S. production has also been hampered‚Äîin this case, due to Hurricane Ida. Production has dipped by 1.5 million bpd in recent weeks, adding to the tight supply situation created by OPEC+'s underperformers.

Add to what some see as inadequate production the tight supply situation for natural gas in Europe. This could also increase the demand for crude oil and gas supplies run thin.

Iraqi Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said over the weekend that if all goes to plan, the market will remain in balance through Q1 2022, with Brent at $70 per barrel, if OPEC+ sticks to its plan.

**Opinion:**

There appears to be a common misconception that if oil prices get to high, ""OPEC will just turn on the spigot"" or ""US Shale will come roaring back with production to fill the supply gap.""  While that could've been true in the past, the game has completely changed due to under investment (both OPEC and US) and a new commitment across the to increase investor returns (US Oil companies).   
 **It appears that we are absolutely headed for $80-100/barrel by the end of the year.**  **Prove me wrong!**

With all of the above stated...

# I think that Marathon Oil (MRO) is the best way to play the eventual Oil Price boom

* **MRO (Marathon Oil) is up over 200% from it's October lows**
* **MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel**
* **MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to Stock Buy-Backs = Over $1 Billion for 2021 (Q3/Q4)**
   * ***That's currently over 10% of their Market Cap***
* **MRO paid down $1.4 Billion in long-term debt in Q1/Q2 of 2021**
* **MRO is the smallest Oil Company in the S&P 500** (not a Micro Cap that could be bought easily)
* **Bank of American and Goldman Sachs are predicting $80-100/barrel by end of 2021**
* \*\*There are other solid US Equity Oil plays out there, but I feel that MRO is in the best position to boom given their solid balance sheet, low-break even point, and being the **smallest market cap  company of any US Oil Company in the S&P 500** (i.e. institutional/long-term investors will be more likely to pour money into an S & P 500 company than a micro cap once it's fully realized that oil US companies are committed to investor returns vs the old ""drill baby drill"" mentality.

**But, prove me wrong!**  Until then...

**Part 8 ‚Äì TL;DR**

**Part 1 ‚Äì Introduction**

It was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason ‚Äì **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day ‚Äì GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‚Äòmeme mania‚Äô we‚Äôve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. 

Why‚Äôd this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there‚Äôs an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD‚Äôs are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‚Äòmeme stocks‚Äô which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt investigated that particular theory but there‚Äôs plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you‚Äôre so inclined. 

The quick point I‚Äôm trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question ‚Äì and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule ‚Äì seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems ‚Äì for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**

**Part 2 ‚Äì Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

* From an investment into equities point of view ‚Äì S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month ‚Äî other than a slight dip in February ‚Äî over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) 

* Let‚Äôs take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it‚Äôs a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   

* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) 

* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). 

* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states.

* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. 

* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) 

* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) 

* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  

* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois‚Äô clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). 

* By 2030, there‚Äôs expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

**Part 2 ‚Äì Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Before we look into what‚Äôs happened since my last post, let‚Äôs go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. 

It is this modular platform that led to Apple‚Äôs interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car‚Äôs electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).

Apple wasn‚Äôt the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia‚Äôs parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‚Äòpretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal‚Ä¶ Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company‚Äô [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). 

Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo‚Äôs chairman didn‚Äôt feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn‚Äôt factor in the value of Canoo‚Äôs IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo‚Äôs own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) 

Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world‚Äôs flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo‚Äôs suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).

Let‚Äôs take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo‚Äôs approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). 

The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants

* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo‚Äôs new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 ‚Äì layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) 

The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:

Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It‚Äôs pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I‚Äôd recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching late 2022.

* Starting at $34,750*

* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats

* 250 mi range

* Up to 350 Horsepower 

* 28min charge time 80%

* 188 ft¬≥ interior volume

* 80 KWh battery

* 1,464 lbs payload ‚Äì 2,000 lbs capacity

Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) ‚Äì Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Starting at $33,000*

* 200 ft¬≥ - 500 ft¬≥ cargo volume

* 130 ‚Äì 230 mi, 90 ‚Äì 190 mi range (EPA)

* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs

Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) ‚Äì All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility ‚Äî ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching as early as 2023.

* Price ‚Äì Not currently listed, but during the Q&A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category ‚Äì you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  

* Targeted HP ‚Äì 500+

* Payload Capacity ‚Äì 1800 lbs

* Range ‚Äì 200+ mi

* Powertrain ‚Äì AWD or RWD

There‚Äôs actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn‚Äôt been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). 

We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It‚Äôs important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity ‚Äì highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). 

Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer ‚Äì with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 ‚Äì 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).

To sum it up ‚Äì Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).

Some of these individuals have spent 5-10 years with their prior companies, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that they‚Äôd all be jumping over to Canoo for a 1 year engagement.**

Other than the talent, Canoo has made a number of moves in in recent months as it moves closer to bringing the first of the Lifestyle Vehicles to production, including:

Announcing plans to build its new factory outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating more than 2,000 jobs and opening in 2023. The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).

Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‚Äòis the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.‚Äù The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)

De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:

* >$250M invested in Beta

* ~1.5M hours of engineering

* ~500k miles of testing

* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested

* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.

Undertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:

* >12 months of testing

* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated

* ~70 crash tests

* 30 sled tests

* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts

* 80% of all components are sourced

* 63% of all engineering is released

* 54% of tooling is committed

Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). 

Surpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) 

Showcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars & Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).

**Part 5 ‚Äì Financials and Valuation**

Before looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs

* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) 

* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) 

* Bank of America - $5 (can‚Äôt find the article at the moment but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen it somewhere)

Average = $13, current SP = $6.7

As of Canoo‚Äôs second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). 

The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.

At a pre-revenue stage there‚Äôs not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:

* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders ‚Äì which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).

* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).

As far as valuations go, let‚Äôs divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look ‚Äì based on their market cap. I‚Äôm sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I‚Äôll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.

* Lucid Motors ‚Äì $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021

* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 

* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 

* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 

* Canoo ‚Äì $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV 

* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B

Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven‚Äôt done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there‚Äôs a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo‚Äôs cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  

**Part 6 ‚Äì Bear Case**

With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that‚Äôs pretty much it in a sentence. Since I‚Äôm on the bullish side for the company, I‚Äôll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won‚Äôt be running out of $$$ before it comes to market ‚Äì these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I‚Äôll summarize them below:

* As of Canoo‚Äôs second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. 

* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.

* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.

* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production ‚Äì H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to go the additional equity route.

* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) ‚Äì nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.

**Part 7 ‚Äì SI and Squeeze Potential**

I know y‚Äôall have just been waiting for this so I‚Äôll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that‚Äôll help understand GOEV‚Äôs squeezability.

* Short Interest ‚Äì 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float 

* Market Cap ‚Äì $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it‚Äôs immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital

* Extremely Memeable ‚Äì I mean‚Ä¶ GOEV, like Go‚Ä¶ EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria

* Low Liquidity ‚Äì Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)

* Low Risk (IV) ‚Äì Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you‚Äôre one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it‚Äôs not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There‚Äôs not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn‚Äôt have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I‚Äôd agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.

**Part 8 ‚Äì TL;DR**

The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. 

President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. 

Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.

To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world‚Äôs flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)

* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

If we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it‚Äôs $4,000 rebate ‚Äì that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you‚Äôre getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.

If you made it this far, I‚Äôd like to thank you for reading this ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won‚Äôt).

117,pt79cw,1632316360.0,qxk72,ElectroFried,"I think I worked out what has had Burry and others worked up about Evergrande. Is this GFC 2.0, featuring our new friend the Orphan SPV?","Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right?  
  
So I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo.  
  
And here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending?   
  
Well, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then.   
  
Bring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not).  
  
So, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently.    
  
I know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here? Please let me know because I am more than a little concerned now.",300,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28977e0d0>
118,pt7419,1632315864.0,4n75d,Thereian,Atlas Air (AAWW) DD Part 2: FedEx earnings were incredible...for Atlas Air,"This is an update on my [AAWW DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/), based on what we learned from the FedEx earnings call. I know it is heavily focused on FedEx, but theres a lot of reading between the lines here and it all looks amazing for Atlas Air.

\----

**Recap**

In [Part 1 of my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) on Atlas Air WorldWide (AAWW) I outlined the following points:

* AAWW trades at a P/E of <5
* AAWW is hugely benefiting from global supply disruptions
* Those supply disruptions have no end in sight
* Even when they do end, the shift of passenger airlines to narrow-body jets will drop airfreight volume capabilities by \~20%, and AAWW will be needed to fill this gap
* 13.6% of the float is shorted
* The CARES act restriction on buybacks will end **this month**.

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

\----

**FedEx Earnings Call**

>Turning now to International, we are forecasting air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025... **We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022, a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024.** Global air cargo capacity ... is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Capacity on international lanes remain scarce and we have seen European and APAC export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. -Brie Carere, *Chief Marketing and Communications Officer*

**FedEx Earnings**

Today we got to hear earnings from FedEx (FDX), a major global shipper and customer of AAWW. But yesterday, we got a sneak preview when it was announced that [FedEx is increasing its rates by 5.9% to 7.9% next year](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/business/fedex-shipping-price-increase/index.html). For your reference, that's the most in [over a decade](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/fedex-raise-rates-most-decade) \- a clear indicator that they don't expect their costs to come down.

In [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/comment/hdr1bfv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), before the earnings were released, I made it clear what we want to see from FedEx: high revenues and high costs. And that is exactly what we saw. Revenues are up pretty significantly (on top of a strong year when stay at home drove high delivery volumes) - this signals strong demand. But the bigger, most beautiful line item is ""Purchased Transportation."" FedEx spent $5.66B on outsourced transport this quarter. That is almost 14% higher than this same time last year.

[FedEx Earnings Strong, Expenses Stronger](https://preview.redd.it/980yspczy1p71.png?width=2692&format=png&auto=webp&s=9be75953044ed232a714c664b7cd7afafba5f70c)

Now, I know what you think... ""How do we know how much of that Purchased Transportation went to airfreight?"" Good news. They split it out by segment. On page 23 of the report, FedEx states the following:

[FedEx Statement on Purchased Transportation Costs, page 23](https://preview.redd.it/717oaiu1z1p71.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0f8de62b89b1b5d9af4566f5cd3cb9d3886e52)

I will emphasize the higher volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight...!

Now, it's safe to assume:

* FedEx Ground labor costs have nothing to do with our beloved Atlas Air.
* FedEx Express consists of a decent chunk of airfreight.
* FedEx Freight is significantly airfreight.

\--

**FedEx Express**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased 19% YOY, from 1.3B to 1.55B this quarter. \[Page 28\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 19% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers and increased rates."" \[Page 29\]

Now, to be clear, the majority of FedEx Express's *Purchased Transportation* is almost certainly not airfreight. The actual percentage of increased expense on outsourced airfreight is probably better indicated in FedEx Freight...

**FedEx Freight**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased **41% YOY**, from 170M to 239M. \[Page 31\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 41% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the challenging labor market resulting in increased utilization of third-party service providers and higher rates."" \[Page 32\]

This is a huge indicator not just of FedEx's spend with Atlas Air, but the general market void that AAWW is filling...!

\--

**So Where Are We Now?**

The FedEx earnings report could not have gone any better for Atlas. The numbers speak volumes. But beyond that, FedEx spells it out for us quite clearly in their Business Outlook section, and the section capturing their future aircraft orders.

The Business Outlook section includes this fun reading:

>""However, we expect costs associated with the challenging labor market, **including increased purchased transportation costs**, higher labor costs, and network inefficiencies, **to continue to pressure operating profit growth during the remainder of 2022.**"" - Page 25, Outlook

And the Commitments section makes it even more clear:

>During the first quarter of 2022, **FedEx Express exercised options to purchase an additional 20 B767F aircraft, ten of which will be delivered in 2024 and ten of which will be delivered in 2025**. - Page 16

And sure enough, as of this morning, we got news that FedEx [expanded its agreement with Atlas](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/22/2301286/34720/en/Atlas-Air-Worldwide-Announces-New-ACMI-Contract-with-FedEx.html). You can bet that expanding that agreement right now was at top dollar.

TL;DR FedEx might as well have said ""We're so desperate to move freight that we gave Atlas Air a blank check...and they cashed it for so much money we had to raise rates higher/faster than we have in over a decade. And we bought 20 additional planes...which wont be delivered for 2-3 years.""

121,pt6yhw,1632315360.0,ajdjb39d,JohnnyTheBoneless,How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style. Part 2.,"Hi all -

This is the second installment to a post I made back in May on r/Burryology that documented some of my inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's 13F plays. Folks seemed to get something out of that post so I thought I'd post part 2 to wsb.

Do keep in mind that this is analysis of his stock picks for Q2 2021 and that his views on the economy have likely changed given the Evergrande situation (this is my own speculation based on his tweets from this week).

By my estimate, 28.4% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. I arrived at this number by going through the individual positions of Scion's Q2 2021 13F, using the ""Think Back"" function in ThinkOrSwim to estimate options contracts prices, and summing the resulting positions together.

# US 20+ year Treasury ETFs (7.6% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio)

Burry's treasury instrument of choice is the 20+ year bond. This is a direct play on inflation where he's essentially concluding that the Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates which will lead to an increase in bond yields thereby causing their prices to fall. TLT is tied to the bond price itself. TBT is tied to the inverse of the yield (so when the yield falls, TBT goes up 2x that rate (in theory)).

He has positions in both TLT and TBT (see below for descriptions). It should be noted that both of these positions first appeared in Scion's 13F in Q1 2021. It should also be noted that he reduced his TBT position and increased his TLT position in Q2 2021. His TLT position is the third largest position in his Q2 2021 portfolio (which, in my opinion, says something about which ETF he prefers).

**Put Options on** [Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)](https://investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) **- 7.2% of current holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates, leading to increased yields and making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

Some context: The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds (link).

**Call Options on** [Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treas etf (TBT)](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) **- 0.4% of holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on a 2x inverse bond ETF.

Context: The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

# Energy, Commodities, and Transport (11% of current holdings)

Commodities are a fairly traditional inflation play. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020816/importance-commodity-pricing-understanding-inflation.asp) on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. The challenge with each of these companies is determining whether the company is an explicit hedge against inflation or whether it‚Äôs a value investing play.

[Ovintiv Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ovintiv-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-and-operating-results-301342593.html) **(Pan Canadian Energy - Encana Corp.) (OVV) - 4.06% of current holdings**

This is the 6th largest Scion position and the 2nd largest shares-only position (i.e., no options contracts).

Probable Thesis: First, it's an oil & gas company (meaning the commodities checkbox is checked on this one). Second, it's arguably a riskier investment at the moment. They have very little cash on the balance sheet (enough for 1 day of operations). They are currently redirecting their cash flow towards paying down long-term debt which in itself is another positive for inflationary times (one group that does particularly well during inflation is debtors as the debt inflates itself away).

Golden Ocean Group Limited **(GOGL) and two other companies that I won't specify as they are under 1.5B market cap - 1.7% and 5.3%**

I grouped these positions together as they each clock in below 3% of the overall portfolio. Each of these was also an existing position that Burry added to in Q2 2021.

***\[Redacted\] and Golden Ocean Group***

These two are likely plays on ocean freight/transport inflation. \[Redacted\] is tied to oil transport and is a proxy play on any boost to oil demand that occurs at the global level. Golden Ocean Group looks similar but tied specifically to dry bulk goods.

***\[Redacted Energy Company\]***

This is the one that I'm leaning more towards ""value investing play"" and less towards inflation (but I could be wrong). The arguments in favor of it being an inflation play are that it‚Äôs a commodity company (coal), it just recently started paying a dividend, and its been working towards deleveraging (at least that was the case earlier in the year). These are themes that you'll see in other investments such as CVS Health below.

# Revenue Mammoths (9.8% of current holdings)

The final group of companies are the revenue mammoths. They hail from the retail, grocery, and pharmacy sectors. All four of these organizations are in the top 31 companies in the world by revenue. They have some combination of pharmaceutical distribution and retail/grocery. They offer dividends with two of them being dividend aristocrats.

**CVS Health (Call Options and Shares) - 4.7% of portfolio**

Interestingly, CVS Health is the only stock where Burry is currently holding both shares and call options. They are the [7th largest company in the world by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) (hence the revenue mammoth term).

The characteristics that make CVS an interesting potential inflation play are:

‚Ä¢ They have a large pharmaceutical distribution presence

‚Ä¢ They have a large health insurance segment

‚Ä¢ They have a sizeable retail store segment

‚Ä¢ They froze their dividend in 2018 to pay down debt related to their Aetna acquisition

What makes these intriguing characteristics from the inflation perspective?

Healthcare and pharmaceuticals have consistently beaten inflation over the past several decades. Pharmaceutical drugs continue to trend up. CVS owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.

From the retail perspective, their ""front"" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.

Lastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. Their stock price is arguably depressed due to the massive $69 billion acquisition of Aetna they made in 2018. They had been increasing dividends every year for almost 2 decades before this acquisition, at which point they froze the dividend and put the money towards their debt. They estimate that they'll hit their debt-to-capitalization ratio in Spring of next year (I personally think it will be summer or fall of next year). At that point, it is anticipated that they will resume dividend hikes and share buybacks as they've done historically.

With CVS, you have a potential case where the 7th largest company in the world by revenue is undervalued due to a large amount of debt that they are slowly and steadily paying off in an advantageous inflationary environment with a predicted return to hiking their dividends in 2022 (and they appear to be largely inflation-proof).

**The Opioid Twins: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health (Call Options only) - 2.9% of portfolio**

Two more pharmaceutical revenue mammoths: McKesson clocks in at #12 on the largest companies by revenue list and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. They also own a chain of 4000 pharmacy stores. Cardinal Health clocks in at 14th by revenue and is in the top 5 largest pharmaceutical distributors with McKesson. Both offer similar inflation characteristics to the ones listed for CVS Health with the difference being that CVS owns a health insurance plan on top of their pharmacy retail/PBM businesses.

Another key difference between CVS Health and the duo of McKesson and Cardinal is that McKesson and Cardinal Health were penalized in July of 2021 for their role in the Opioid crisis. Cardinal Health [expects to pay $6.4 billion over 18 years](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/07/22/cardinal-health-pay-6-4-billion-part-opioid-settlement/8053626002/) for its share of a $26 billion opioid settlement. It's possible that this legislation is currently a drag on these two stocks.

**Walmart (Call Options only) - 1% of portfolio**

Walmart is an interesting case because, at first glance, it appears to make more sense as an inflation play than the rest of this mammoth revenue group. Walmart is the largest company on Earth by yearly revenue. They have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.

What makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. They have a large breadth of products which allows them to keep the prices of various product categories lower than their competitors. They also own the basket that the goods live in (along with the land around the basket). Real Estate is a well-known inflation hedge.

125,pt6bd6,1632313073.0,kw1h2,frescoj10,Facebook is gonna have boosted human capital financials in approximately 1.5 - 3 years.,"Facebook has been throwing up a bunch of job posts for industrial organizational psychologist over the last month to focus on employee selections. 

I am going to paraphrase a case study for you... it's gonna be choppy cause I am doing this off of memory which is garbage. I could pull the study in an hour or two when I go into work... 

Background: 
Back in the day federal government implemented the use of employee selections. They conducted a utility analysis on the selections assessments across a wide variety of factors (turnover, retention, performance, etc.) It was determined that there was a cost savings of approximately 18 billion dollars over a period of time. 

Facebook has been posting a bunch of these positions over the last few weeks - I know this cause I applied to a few of them. Not a fan of their policies, but I am willing to sell my soul for money - ya heard? 

If they fill the positions within 2-3 months, people will probably start to working towards their development, validation, and implementation cycles within the following 9 months. Based on their postings the positions may initially be geared to high volume entry level and mid level positions. I estimate that within 1.5-3 years they will start to have better financials surrounding human capital. It will take a little bit of time to show the benefits concerning retention while the herd is culled and replaced with better hires.

130,pt3sx8,1632302762.0,eeh6ers8,RealDamland,Discovery & WarnerMedia Merger - Let's Discuss,"Background

In May of this year Discovery Inc. and WarnerMedia (part of AT&T group as of now) are set to merge in mid 2022. Discovery stock series C (ticker DISCK) is looking like a very good buying opportunity as discovery shareholders are to receive 29% of the new company. From what I know, DISCA and DISCK (basically have different voting rights) will both receive 1 to 1 shares in the new company (not 100% about DISCB), yet DISCK is trading cheaper right now because DISCA has more voting rights. Basically, the different series represent different voting rights which will be irrelevant after the merger.

&#x200B;

Theory

**Michael Burry**

In Q2 2021 Michael Burry added \~855,000 shares of $DISCK at around $29 to his portfolio, this represents \~18% of his portfolio (excluding cash and options). This adds to my confidence in the potential of this company, it isn't wise to assume it's a good investment just because someone bought it, although Michael Burry is definitely a very intelligent person and knows exactly what he is doing, he tends to bet big when he is very confident and $25,000,000 in $DISCK is a pretty good indicator of his confidence. He predicted the GFC and failure of MBS in 2007-2008, he read thousands of papers regarding the mortgages, so he does his research.

&#x200B;

**Potential**

Since the announcement of the merger on May 17 $DISCK is down approx. 20%. As of writing this it is trading at around $25 a share. I am going to mostly avoid talking about valuations in this post as I believe it is quite hard to put an exact value on it right now because of the plethora of factors that contribute to its valuation. At the beginning of this year Discovery released its streaming service Discovery+ which amassed 15 million subscribers quite quickly and currently has 18 million. There seems to be quite a big, and underestimated, potential after the merge. They are expected to generate $14B EBITDA and \~$8.4B FCF in the first year after the merge, 2023. Additionally, there is a synergy target of $3B (additional cash flow resulting from merger alone). Discovery+ has only launched in 3 countries and is expected to grow a lot more as they expand out. WarnerMedia's HBO Max is also growing, they currently have a combined subscriber count of 85 million and they are projected to have around 200 million by around 2025 from the information I gathered. The streaming potential is too difficult to ignore, ""Discovery is the undisputed leader in nonfiction and lifestyle programming."" Once the merger is complete, their combined networks and media groups should appeal to many different age groups and demographics. David Zaslav (CEO of Discovery) said that they will be spending around $20B on content together.

Discovery's DTC (Direct To Consumer) model looks to be very strong, as they are selling and reselling content on their streaming service but also cable TV.

&#x200B;

**Archegos & Stock dip in March**

As I'm sure all of you know Bill Hwang had to liquidate his positions in many companies in March, one of them which he had a substantial position in, was $DISCK. That is why the price plummeted earlier this year if you were curious.

**Legacy & Cable TV**

The cable TV industry and regular networks have been slowing down with the rise of streaming services that offer everything at your fingertips for a low price. I do believe Discovery and WarnerMedia will be able to stay on top of this and make up for their slowing Cable TV businesses with their new streaming services and content production.

&#x200B;

**Financials & Ratios**

They are currently trading at a PE of 15x.

&#x200B;

**Debt**

One of the biggest concerns regarding these media companies and the merger as a whole is the debt. Discovery will contribute \~$15B and WarnerMedia \~$43B in debt to the new company. This is definitely a substantial amount of debt. They will be producing a lot of cash flow, yet the question is will they be able to cover the debt even if interest rates rise? I am interested to see your opinions. I had a look at AT&T and Discovery's annual reports and at the debt payments required over the next 5 years, it does not look so troublesome compared to the amount of cash they are producing even if the interest rate goes up to let's say, 5%. But I would definitely like to hear more from others as to whether they are at risk or not.

As addressed in their merger presentation, they will be targeting ""rapid deleveraging"" going from 5x EBIDTA to 3x EBIDTA within 24 months and have a long-term goal of 2.5-3x.

The (debt) deal will include a $31.5B bridge, $10B in term loans and a $6B credit line. ""Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan won the prized mandate to lead a $47.5 billion funding effort, and have now spread the financing among 20 of its peers on Wall Street, according to bankers familiar with the deal"". *Source: Insider*

&#x200B;

Conclusion

It looks like the market is undervaluing the potential of this new company which will arise in 2022. There are many worries regarding debt, profitability and the success of the new business. Although I believe it is being underestimated and $DISCK shares are selling pretty cheap right now. I've looked at other options including $DISCA, $DISCB and $T but $DISCK looks like the best value.

Yeahh.... sooo Xinnie the Pooh just [took over Evergrande and is making it state-owned. What this means is that it can‚Äôt really default and the crisis is averted.](https://asiamarkets.com/imminent-china-evergrande-deal-will-see-ccp-take-control/).

**But don‚Äôt panic because there‚Äôs good news.**

I think $YANG Gang may have gotten lucky. See, YANG tracks the FTSE 50 China for Hong Kong, not Shanghai. Today, Hong Kong markets were closed because of a holiday. This means they haven‚Äôt mooned yet and most likely YANG will not move much. This gives enough time to let go of current positions before the next day when Hong Kong markets reopen and YANG could die.

Ofc, the best way to play this is to switch to YINN calls. 

Also, the [Shanghai FTSE index](https://www.investing.com/indices/ftse-china-a50) is still down 1.5% so even if YANG went off the FTSE 50 China for Shanghai, it would still be green tmrw and calls will print.


The only reason I would switch to YANG calls or YINN puts as of now is because this solves the onshore bond issues and payments to Chinese investors. Offshore bond owners are still screwed so the US and other international investors won‚Äôt actually receive their payments. This could potentially reflect bad on Chinese markets but may have a greater impact on banks in the US who are exposed to their debt. Like HSBC for example. 

**TLDR;  China stopped the Evergrande crisis for now but because YANG tracks FTSE Hong Kong &amp; Hong Kong markets have been closed and Shanghai market is still down -1.5%, exiting YANG calls is ideal tomorrow with minimal risk.**",72,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28a5fc100>
133,pt1r13,1632292843.0,bv9db1dl,StockJesus78,StockJesus Interesting Trades,"Here are the trades that you need to be watching for tommorow (FOMC).  These trades will probably some of the most profitable trades for tommorow.

TSLA-  showed relative strength against the market, this could be due to the fact that tsla is a unique stock.

1. TSLA- has a cult
2. TSLA- its made up of a institutional but also alot of retail traders
3. Will probably be the last one standing if the market flushes, but by that token it is the one most likely to gain after FOMC tommorow

TSLA is also in a bullflag formation and showed relative strength against the market

&#x200B;

If the FOMC is positive tommorow, we can expect to see a big rally in tsla as it breaks the resistance level at $742.

&#x200B;

The other charts that has big potential for tommorow will be the TLT and the VIX.  The VIX has been holding strong above the 20.  The VIX will pop huge if spy flushes down tommorow

Other Trades that I like:

GDRX- this is the play that you want to play instead of alot of the trash shortsqueeze stocks.  This is one of the better short squeeze plays out there.  Idiots think, that if the short interest is high, thats all you need,  but dont realize alot of other factors go into short squeezes.

CRVS-  This stock pumped today, but I expect more gains for the next couple of days as long as the market dosent tank tommorow.

EEM-  If you want to play the china/Evergrande trade, this is it.  This is the developing countries ETF and china is heavily weighted in it.  Buying puts for more pain to come on a longer dated options.

I hope you guys enjoy these plays and good luck with your trades

I know it is heavily focused on FedEx, but theres a lot of reading between the lines here and it all looks amazing for Atlas Air.

\----

**Recap**

In [Part 1 of my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) on Atlas Air WorldWide (AAWW) I outlined the following points:

* AAWW trades at a P/E of <5
* AAWW is hugely benefiting from global supply disruptions
* Those supply disruptions have no end in sight
* Even when they do end, the shift of passenger airlines to narrow-body jets will drop airfreight volume capabilities by \~20%, and AAWW will be needed to fill this gap
* 13.6% of the float is shorted
* The CARES act restriction on buybacks will end **this month**.

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

\----

**FedEx Earnings Call**

>Turning now to International, we are forecasting air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025... **We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022, a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024.** Global air cargo capacity ... is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Capacity on international lanes remain scarce and we have seen European and APAC export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. -Brie Carere, *Chief Marketing and Communications Officer*

&#x200B;

**FedEx Earnings**

Today we got to hear earnings from FedEx (FDX), a major global shipper and customer of AAWW. But yesterday, we got a sneak preview when it was announced that [FedEx is increasing its rates by 5.9% to 7.9% next year](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/business/fedex-shipping-price-increase/index.html). For your reference, that's the most in [over a decade](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/fedex-raise-rates-most-decade) \- a clear indicator that they don't expect their costs to come down.

In [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/comment/hdr1bfv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), before the earnings were released, I made it clear what we want to see from FedEx: high revenues and high costs. And that is exactly what we saw. Revenues are up pretty significantly (on top of a strong year when stay at home drove high delivery volumes) - this signals strong demand. But the bigger, most beautiful line item is ""Purchased Transportation."" FedEx spent $5.66B on outsourced transport this quarter. That is almost 14% higher than this same time last year.

[FedEx Earnings Strong, Expenses Stronger](https://preview.redd.it/uq0db5wx6zo71.png?width=2692&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb217195aab212937470cb5cede823039891263)

Now, I know what you think... ""How do we know how much of that Purchased Transportation went to airfreight?"" Good news. They split it out by segment. On page 23 of the report, FedEx states the following:

[FedEx Statement on Purchased Transportation Costs, page 23](https://preview.redd.it/z3wakamq8zo71.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=01e3a8ffa91aba49f459f260c362d1788ade450d)

I will emphasize the higher volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight...!

Now, it's safe to assume:

* FedEx Ground labor costs have nothing to do with our beloved Atlas Air.
* FedEx Express consists of a decent chunk of airfreight.
* FedEx Freight is significantly airfreight.

\--

**FedEx Express**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased 19% YOY, from 1.3B to 1.55B this quarter. \[Page 28\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 19% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers and increased rates."" \[Page 29\]

Now, to be clear, the majority of FedEx Express's *Purchased Transportation* is almost certainly not airfreight. The actual percentage of increased expense on outsourced airfreight is probably better indicated in FedEx Freight...

**FedEx Freight**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased **41% YOY**, from 170M to 239M. \[Page 31\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 41% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the challenging labor market resulting in increased utilization of third-party service providers and higher rates."" \[Page 32\]

This is a huge indicator not just of FedEx's spend with Atlas Air, but the general market void that AAWW is filling...!

\--

**So Where Are We Now?**

The FedEx earnings report could not have gone any better for Atlas. The numbers speak volumes. But beyond that, FedEx spells it out for us quite clearly in their Business Outlook section, and the section capturing their future aircraft orders.

The Business Outlook section includes this fun reading:

>""However, we expect costs associated with the challenging labor market, **including increased purchased transportation costs**, higher labor costs, and network inefficiencies, **to continue to pressure operating profit growth during the remainder of 2022.**"" - Page 25, Outlook

And the Commitments section makes it even more clear:

>During the first quarter of 2022, **FedEx Express exercised options to purchase an additional 20 B767F aircraft, ten of which will be delivered in 2024 and ten of which will be delivered in 2025**. - Page 16

&#x200B;

TL;DR FedEx might as well have said ""We're so desperate to move freight that we gave Atlas Air a blank check...and they cashed it for so much money we had to raise rates higher/faster than we have in over a decade. And we bought 20 additional planes...which wont be delivered for 2-3 years.""

&#x200B;

This is a $9 spread (21%) and is expected to close in 4Q. This means it could close within 90-120 days which would be an annualized return of 80%+\-. The reason for the spread is that some fear that the deal could be blocked by regulators. However, 13 members of congress recently wrote a letter supporting the deal. 

https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-lockheeds-aerojet-deal-gets-support-13-members-congress-letter-2021-09-01/

Aerojet is one of the last standalone propulsion companies and supplies to LMT and Raytheon. Raytheon is trying to block the deal, but I don‚Äôt think that should be an issue as there are other competitors that are not standalone propulsion companies (Northrup Grumman). Additionally, we have now seen companies create their own i.e Space X etc so there are plenty of other propulsion competitors. 

Additionally, if the deal were to fail Aerojet should not see a significant price drop as they are still a strong company as a standalone and may trade down to mid 30s as the previously were if the deal is not completed. As such, with an upside of 20+% within 4 months and limited downside if the deal is not completed seems like a no brainer.",16,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x289355fd0>

These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.

Like most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.

Usually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.

# Idea

The main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that ‚Äúspots‚Äù companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.

# Features

Since I‚Äôm not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:

\- **Company related**

Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..

\- **Earnings related**  
I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA

\- **News related**  
The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :

https://preview.redd.it/fl9lxoq70zo71.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f9193c02adb5a4cfd56825e37b5f47ba68d444

# Target

Now that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.

We end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.

# Model

The next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).

We obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

https://preview.redd.it/9d8ku0790zo71.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ba3d87e028435dee6d4f4332efa87fc1959f99

# Results

To backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.

Looking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability > 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we‚Äôre keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):

I use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning. I wrote [this articl](https://medium.com/@EarningsWatcher/picking-options-for-risky-earnings-trades-2d49dcb847e)e about that process.

- they support healthy competition as long as companies are aligned to CCP values and goals 
- they crack down on anything that risks destabilizing the economy/country/CCP
- they are pushing for more ‚Äòwealth redistribution‚Äô 
- they have taken very aggressive regulatory actions and have appetite for more
- they want to keep foreign investors involved and invested
- they want to repatriate Chinese companies back to China (primary listings) and don‚Äôt want to scare off innovative companies and talent
- they are tripling down on Communist ideology (Xi Jinping Thought) and trying to embed it in everything

Given above, how do they reconcile ‚Äòwealth redistribution‚Äô goal with their clear commitment to command economy with strong roots in capitalism?

They cannot nationalize companies, cannot impose government leadership, cannot dramatically increase taxes (without substantial obstacles). How do they encourage economic growth and development of industries/domestic champions without stifling them with communism? 

Potential option: partial nationalization by forcing every single corporation to issue shares towards a Chinese sovereign wealth fund, and keep Chinese government as ~25% shareholder of every company. This would: 
- act as a one off event and alleviate ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô around tamarin CCP actions. Current discount due to uncertainty is likely bigger than 25% anyway. 
- create wealth to be redistributed/borrowed against, with potential for dividends later
- likely will be brushed off by foreign investors (they had already accepted joint venture schemes in the past)

153,psy0qu,1632277874.0,c2424mdp,HiddenGooru,SPY and Gamma Squeezes," Hey guy

I   come to you to discuss a rather interesting development in the  markets!  In short: SPY is in a gamma squeeze, and not a good one like  last time.

This  post will be  relatively lengthy, as I am going to try to lay out my  system as well  as the interpretation of it. But there will be a lot of  pictures. I  don't usually [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/HiddenGooru/posts/?sort=top)   about SPY, but rather other stocks that are in Reddit's sphere of   interest at the time. But the changes on SPY are worth mentioning to you   guys.

Let's start with what I  do:  I look at price directing forces on a stock and quantify them.  Certain  stocks and certain characteristics, so each time I do this its   particular to the given stock. I developed a metric to do this called   VoEx - its aim is to show when a stock is over exposed to certain   price-directing agents that can cause characteristic, deterministic, and   predictable consequences.

So, let's look at VoEx for SPY:

&#x200B;

[ SPY for 2021-09-20. VoEx-daily is Magenta, VoEx-trend is tan, blue is   SPY's price. The horizontal lines are the inhibition line \(top\), and the   propagation line \(bottom\).  ](https://preview.redd.it/ms8n30zcuyo71.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a15dc639face767a057e161b9aed24893554858)

This is VoEx. The magenta line is   VoEx-daily, the tan line in VoEx-tan, and the blue line is the price of   SPY. There are two horizontal lines as well, these are the inhibition   line (top), and propagation line (bottom).  The idea is that when VoEx   is between these two lines: all is well. But when VoEx is outside of   these lines, all is not well.

You'll notice several things:

1. When   VoEx-daily (magenta) experiences a significant spike into the   inhibition zone (above inhibition line), the price falls; where:  

   1. There is a loose association with the strength and duration of the spike and the subsequent price-reversion
2. It is not uncommon for VoEx-daily to dip into the propagation zone (bottom horizontal bar),
3. It is *very* uncommon for VoEx-trend to dip into the propagation zone.

In fact, the only other time on this graph that VoEx-trend dipped into the propagation zone was *February 2020.*

There are those who suggest the market crash in 2020 was purely because of Covid. To that I have this to show:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for SPY from 2018-2020  ](https://preview.redd.it/2gxcixreuyo71.png?width=3836&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a57f0bb0fe18dc869d8a4d831adbc2c80010a7)

 

You'll, again, notice that VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation zone is **never** a good thing.

To demonstrate how significant this is, here are some other VoEx graphs:

Here's BABA:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for BABA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/5vlib18guyo71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=f590a524d5626be88d112fd4db745a970fca7181)

 

You'll notice that VoEx-trend slipped into the propagation zone around Feb of 2020 - and BABA hasn't done well since.

Same with EDU:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for EDU on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/hazhqjqhuyo71.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aaf660da4e6a8a67825f45336769931e2ee57b2)

 Here's TSLA: 

  


[ VoEx for TSLA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/wuoqpj6juyo71.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2cef4520a5304dc7a328aae7097d2fb9e0008c)

 

Naturally, these, however, are single stocks - not an entire Market-wide ETF.

To add to matters, SPY is currently in a gamma squeeze to the tune of almost **12 million shares per point**.

One   of the things I do is directionalize options; I can place them as   dealer long or dealer short. So getting a grasp of   delta is pretty handy at times. Want to see how this affects SPY's price?

&#x200B;

[ Hedging matrix for SPY 2021-09-20. The hedging matrix shows the amount   of shares that have to be purchased \(+\) or sold \(-\) per point move in   price and IV.   ](https://preview.redd.it/it8hb0qluyo71.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac23dbb883a19820f28472c6d3e22f52d417cc3b)

 

This shows that for every point decrease and IV increase in SPY, **12 million** shares must be sold. Yesterday alone saw a **7 point** price depreciation and a **5 point** increase in IV that equated to: **137,493,216** shares that had to be sold. Yesterday's gamma squeeze on SPY was less than it was today.

So in short - historically VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation line has been met with market corrections/crashes.

So we will see if the mods even allow this.I thought to myself the other day about ‚Äúapex‚Äù companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.   


For example:  
Social Media:   
Facebook  
Online Shopping (and cloud..): Amazon  
Search: Google  
Smartphones: Apple  
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you‚Äôre a top company, they‚Äôre using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What‚Äôs Amazon‚Äôs Twitter using? What‚Äôs Google‚Äôs Twitter using? What‚Äôs ESPN (Disney) using?  


Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):  
Netflix  
Microsoft  
Twitter  
Amazon

Google  
The Marines (yep, it‚Äôs been government-certified)  
TSA  
Accenture

Deloitte  
McDonalds (tendies)

If you work at a big company, you‚Äôll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they‚Äôre expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it‚Äôs generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you‚Äôre already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 ‚Äúbig‚Äù customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they‚Äôre clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.
2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren‚Äôt going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn‚Äôt really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they‚Äôre targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.
2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I‚Äôm invested in Sprout as well; they‚Äôve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There‚Äôs probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.
3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.
4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn‚Äôt start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can‚Äôt be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%. Options not a bad idea.

TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the ‚ÄúSalesforce of Social Media Management‚Äù. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

206,psnvau,1632246208.0,9z0opsh3,StonkDoctor1000,RNW about to make India greener than a gamma knife (DESPAC),"ReNew Power (""ReNew"" or ""the Company""), India's leading renewable energy company, today announced that it helped India avoid 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions, in its recently released sustainability report for FY20-21. The report, prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) sustainability reporting standards has been assured by a globally renowned assurance agency, DNV GL Business Assurance India Private Limited (DNV). The report highlights ReNew Power's achievements across the three important pillars of Environment, Society and Governance .

Highlights of the report include:

\-- During the reporting year, ReNew Power's commitment to environmental stewardship helped India avoid 0.5% of its Green House Gas emissions, contributing significantly towards India's quest to achieve the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) as pledged by the Government of India under the Paris agreement.

\-- By generating power through clean energy, ReNew helped the power sector avoid 1.1% of its green house emissions. ReNew's avoided emissions were more than 200 times that of its scope 1 & 2 emissions.

\-- The company has been critically monitoring its water footprint and has saved over 66,000 kiloliters of water by deploying robotic cleaning of solar panels.

\-- ReNew has undertaken steps to boost diversity and inclusion aimed at increasing the gender ratio in the Company. The Company has also received the Great Place to Work recognition twice and has been recognized among the best employers in India in the category this past year by Great Place to Work.

\-- Financial contributions towards energy access, water conservation, COVID relief, women empowerment and community development helped over 400,000 people across 200+ villages in 9 states.

\-- ReNew Power continues to strengthen its governance mechanisms and is among the first companies in the sector to launch a 'Sustainable Supply Chain Framework.' Under this framework, ReNew will screen its suppliers on aspects such as human rights, minimum wages and forced and child labour among others.

\-- ReNew's governance standards exceed requirements for global foreign listed entities on Nasdaq and has a majority independent and gender diverse Board.

Speaking on the occasion, Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power said, ""ReNew Power's sustainability report is an account of our achievements in line with our vision of leading India's energy transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. Our sustainability report clearly outlines how India's environment is positively impacted through our actions. Sustainability is central to our business and ReNew Power's mission is to play a pivotal role in meeting India's growing energy needs in an efficient, sustainable, and socially responsible manner.""

Ms. Vaishali Nigam Sinha, Chief Sustainability Officer and Chair ReNew Foundation said, ""The sustainability report comes at a critical juncture as the world is realizing the dangers of climate change and the importance of shared responsibility. At ReNew Power, we are committed to going the extra mile with all relevant stakeholders to create a better society and better planet. ReNew's growth over the past decade is a testimony to the fact that companies with a purpose can provide great value to their shareholders and investors.""

About ReNew Power

ReNew is India's leading renewable energy Independent Power Producer by capacity and is the 10(th) largest global renewable IPP by operational capacity. ReNew develops, builds, owns and operates utility-scale wind and solar energy projects, and distributed solar energy projects. As of August 31, 2021, ReNew Power had a total capacity of approximately 10.2 GW of wind and solar energy projects across India, including commissioned and committed projects from organic and inorganic growth opportunities.

Market Overview -- Renewable Energy Demand in India Poised to Grow

ReNew Power's business model is reinforced by recent trends in the Indian power generation market, as well as the Indian government's green energy targets over the next decade. India's per capita electricity consumption is poised for rapid growth in the next decade, with approximately two-thirds of this incremental demand being met by power from renewable sources. India's global climate commitments regarding reduction of carbon emissions will dictate a transformational change in the power generation mix -- away from fossil fuels, in favor of renewables. At the same time, the Indian government's ambitious target of 450 GW of installed renewables capacity by 2030, a 5x increase over current levels, indicates huge market potential. A steady reduction in costs of generation, driven by technological advances and well-attended auctions will further accelerate renewables adoption.

As India's energy transition gathers pace, ReNew Power's at-scale, geographically-diversified, multi-technology approach, backed by disciplined project execution and superior financial discipline will help the Company sustain its high growth trajectory.

Management Commentary

""The entire ReNew team has remained laser-focused on maintaining our leadership position in Indian renewable energy throughout this process, and we will continue to work to expand clean power generation across India. We have the ability to do even more in bringing affordable, reliable, green, utility-scale power supply to more people and businesses in India through implementation of our proprietary software and AI-enabled monitoring capabilities. We are excited to continue our work developing wind and solar power across India.""

""We have been proud to partner with the ReNew team throughout this process, and look forward to continuing our relationship as we move into the next phase of growth for ReNew after the close of our transaction,"" said Robert Mancini, Chief Executive Officer and Director ""ReNew is now well-positioned to maintain and expand its leadership position as the largest renewable power generation company in India, and lead decarbonization efforts in one of the world's largest and most dynamic economies. With a strong balance sheet, bolstered by over $870 million of cash from the transaction, ReNew offers investors a unique way to play the continued and accelerating clean electrification trend seen across the global economy. I look forward to working with Sumant and the whole ReNew team to bring their vision to reality.""

208,psnsv1,1632246014.0,omqfq,IAMB4TMAN,Evergrande misses some interest payments - China meltdown? - Market Contagion? What's Next? STORY TIME,"[Evergrande missed *some* loan payments](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/evergrande-misses-loan-payments-to-banks-as-bond-deadlines-loom#:~:text=China%20Evergrande%20Group%20missed%20interest,the%20nation's%20biggest%20debt%20restructurings.&text=Evergrande's%20next%20closely%20watched%20debt,pay%20interest%20on%20two%20bonds.). When it comes to things like this, I like to think of the markets like stand-up comedians. Everyone *knows*, but there's only a couple guys who have the balls to speak up about it/act on it. We'll see how this unfolds, but here's my take on this, & why the market seems to be shrugging it off.

I won't go too deep into what happens in a restructuring process here, but the twist to the Evergrande situation is that the CCP is involved, even [explicitly directing who to pay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/china-tells-banks-evergrande-won-t-pay-interest-due-next-week) \- this is very interesting. Nobody other than the ones on the inside will be able to make a good assessment on how the CCP's interests muddy up this situation. But here's how I interpret this - there are multiple parties with multiple interests here, but the CCP's priorities top everyone's. They're going to dictate who stays afloat (& will likely lead to a carveout of these assets to a different suitor in a distressed M&A scenario, but with a price floor as opposed to a fire sale) & the rest will have to get in line for a bailout, assuming there is some semblance of contagion.¬†

**Ok.. what the fuck does that mean? Are we bullish or bearish?**

Let's break the overall situation down first. The real reason I think Evergrande is defaulting is b/c the shift from rural to urban is **slowing**.¬†

Imagine this - you're a Chinaman who moved from the countryside into the city & you've been working for about 5-10 years now. You're now in middle management, you're starting to accumulate assets, & now you're looking for somewhere to invest. You remember when you first left your countryside town to join the rat race in the city & remember you were one of the first ones to jump into the deep end. There are still ***hundreds of millions*** of people still back in the countryside looking at their measly shit paycheck who have been steadily moving in droves to urban city centers like the one you're in.¬†

Here's some stats on this shift:

[December 2020](https://preview.redd.it/m94fgd2n6wo71.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7add5dea6657851227c998551bafc26dce4aeba)

So there are some government programs in place (the Hukou-based system) that I won't go into detail here, but overall the numbers (as of 12/2020) is **156mm - 391mm**. Remember: the US total population is \~330 million. **China has more people than the entire population of the US living in rural areas than urban areas**.

Back to the story - you look at all the rent payments you had to make when you first moved to the city, & now Evergrande is dangling an opportunity for you to 'invest' in a piece of RE in what Westerners label a 'ghost city' so you could one day collect rent on some farmer who decided to move to the city. **On the surface, this is seems to be one of those 'sure thing' investments**. Right?

It *was*. Now, I interpret all this as a legal form of price gouging (charge these fuckers high rents), & Xi + the CCP is concerned. [Chinese RE prices have been booming for years](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/28/in-its-latest-crackdown-china-intensifies-focus-on-real-estate) \- along with it, prospective rents. What's this mean? ***It is getting expensive for the farmer in the countryside to rationalize a move to the city***. After rent, you've got to assume they're going to be earning less at this point.¬†

So now this spigot of steady inflows from rural countrysides to cities to take up jobs & pay rent on RE has significantly slowed down or has stopped completely. Leaving the RE investors expecting these folks to move into these projects bagholding worthless RE.¬†

**This is why I think Evergrande is going through this distressed scenario**, along with a bunch of mishaps in managing capital, but the latter is just a better scapegoat for the international media than a pervasive issue like the one I described. But look under the hood of most companies growing explosively, you're going to find crazy shit. It only becomes negative if you go under. Food for thought.¬†

**So we bullish or bearish?**

**Bullish view**: 1) China bails out Evergrande completely or

2) China lets Evergrande go into restructuring, which will drive some near-term volatility, but funnels interest payments to institutions who are the closest to the CCP & coordinates a distressed sale at prices that are higher than what a free market distressed fire sale could garner. The remaining bagholders either get a bailout from the government assuming some contagion happens. Will be ***very*** interesting to see what they do with US-dollar denominated debt. Biden coming out today saying a bunch of friendly shit about China about how he *does not* want a new Cold War seems to me that his Wall St. backers are cashing in their favor for helping him get elected by getting China to include them in a bailout or have some of the remaining cash flow at Evergrande commit to paying their debt.

Overall - bullish view is the playbook straight out of the US Fed. They kick the can down the road. Implement other initiatives to get the rural folks to come to the cities, but overall complex, as this will end up in the near/medium-term as a blip in RE values, which means rents will still be high. Do they enact rent controls? Do they force some minimum wage? The numbers have to work here for the farmers to replace the veteran iPhone assemblers so the latter can move up to management.¬†

**Bearish view**: China lets Evergrande go into restructuring. They coordinate some interest payments to some debt holders & coordinates a distressed sale at higher prices than what a free market distressed fire sale would garner. They then cherry-pick which institutions to bail out if contagion happens, but overall they just let RE prices drift lower. Basically, they hit the huge **RESET** button on RE & the market goes to shit, but in the long-run, it'll sort itself out.¬†

Funny thing? If this was the US, the Bullish view scenario is what would happen. Who's the real communist? Hah, sToNkS OnLy gO uP!

Overall we have 2 near-term moves that are going to happen though - China either bails out Evergrande in a significant way, or lets it go to restructuring. If the latter, I expect another sell-off like Monday when the news hits the tape, as the US market has not priced in a contagion impact whatsoever (priced in some, yesterday):¬†

ZIM integrated shipping services LTD- Theyre the ones making all the money off the insane container rates right now

TL;DR 6.25 Billion market cap; $7.38 EPS Q2 21; Q3 will likley be higher near $9 EPS a 700% increase over last year; \~1.5 forward P/E ratio; expected to issue \~ $17 dividend Q1 '21
EDIT: $100 PT üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

As soon as you retards are ready to stop blowing all your money on FDs on garbage stocks get ready to blow all your money on monthlies on ZIM. ZIM is a shipping service provider with almost no assets and almost no debt. Their only long term obligations are the leases on their ships. ""but why would I want to own a company with no assets that just leases their ships?!?!?!"" U should be asking ""why would  I want to pay for the massive investments and capEX involved in buying a giant piece of steel when I can simply buy the profits from that chunk of metal?"" ZIM gets to make the profits without spending all their money on depreciating assets.

Speaking of profits... ZIM is printing almost as much money as JPOW. Last quarter they posted earnings of $7.38 and that number was at a lower spot price for cargo. ZIM also has long term contracts that theyre constantly renegotiating at these new higher prices, locking in future profits. Analysts dont expect much for next quarter but I found one (no i dont remember where i read it Ill link it if i find it) who actually calculated it based on their Q2 numbers putting Q3 at \~$9 per share which will stay that way until the supply chain fixes itself and prices come down. this is 1/6 their current market cap every quarter in profit. And we all know the supply chain wont be fixed for at least a year. Plus theyre sitting on a pile of $1.6 Billion in cash and very little debt. By the end of next quarter their cash will be \~$3 higher than their long term debt with no end of profits in sight.

The biggest advantage of ZIM is their flexibility, Without having to own their ships, if container rates start to drop in the future, they can simply not renew their leases or renegotiate at lower prices and avoid having huge liabilities on their books for container ship loans. if container rates stay high, they have contracts that give them the option to lease more ships (which they have already done this year). ZIM wont be bagholding ships the same way people who got in CLOV at $25 are right now. This also helps their margins which are at a smoldering 38% and have ben trending up from 14% for their first quarter as a public company, theyre more efficient than most of their larger competitors but ZIM is quickly gaining market share due to lower prices and higher margins.

By this point some of you have pulled up the chart and have seen how they ran from $9 to $55 right now and will think this is a hype play, wrong, it is still a value play. Q4 '20-Q2 '21 they have seen 100% earnings growth... and its not a tech company. ZIM has had 200% revenue growth y/y for Q2. and only 100% growth in costs. This is what is called operating leverage and it will only increase as they keep renegotiating their long term contracts. The fact that they have long term contracts at these spot prices will be a huge tailwind in years to come as they can maintain massive margins on the shipping services even as the current spot prices come down after next year.

Zim is planning on returning massive profits to shareholders, they already paid a $2 special dividend this year and will likely pay a $10 or more in Q1 next year as their earnings have massively accelerated, and investors LOVE special dividends.

Congratulations on making it to the end as a reward here are my positions. I have been in zim since $40 and kept stacking call options at $60 so I am actually down right now but I have 15 Jan calls and 6 October calls and some shares. Normally I wouldnt like calls on a stock that pays a high dividend but as they are special dividends it gets taken off the strike price and wont hurt the calls at all.",39,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28ce60100>

With that said, this thing is primed for another pullback. \~+20% this past week, making a new ATH, in the past for its run ups it usually pulls back around $20-$60, and I am anticipating the start of a sell off in the next week or so.

Hopefully the attached image can better illustrate my thinking. This is complete degenetard thinking here, but given its history, September/October's track record, this one is gonna pay out decent by mid October I'd guess.

217,psm16p,1632240920.0,10bk95,Ropirito,"$INDI Semi-Conductor, an unknown deSPAC with Low IV, Gamma Ramp, Low Float","# 1. About INDI

Indie  Semiconductor, Inc. provides automotive semiconductors and software  solutions. It offers its solution for advanced driver assistance  systems, including light detection and ranging, connected car, user  experience, and electrification applications.

EV  stocks such as TSLA, LCID, and NIO are mainstream yet not much focus is  put on the providers of components and tech related to them. It is important to look also into the companies that provide all these  essential components and $INDI is the perfect company for this. **More importantly, is that INDI is providing a seriously good setup that seems too perfect to have gone under the radar.**

# 2. The Set-up

# To summarize INDI:

* INDI is a deSPAC. deSPACs have unique characteristics that give them great risk:reward profiles.
* With high OI relative to its new float
* Only about 250,000 shares are available to borrow. This is low relative to INDI‚Äôs float.
* Very few shares are available to borrow.
* Order  flow has been very bullish. Right now INDI is up about 20% in the past  month. Price has been steadily rising with consistent buy flow.
* IV  is mispricing the potential move INDI can experience. Right now INDI  has an Implied Volatility of 76.8%, and most options have a 60% IV. For  example, IRNT had a similar setup and it has IV in the range of 150-200%  for ATM options. VLTA, with an identical setup, has an ATM IV of  100-150%.
* There is currently no discussion of this stock on any of the [investing subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/indi).
* The Market Cap is currently at 1.5 Billion.

**IV is not priced to expect any of these circumstances. It‚Äôs as if Market Makers don‚Äôt know about INDI being a deSpac.**

# 3. deezSpacs:

**Risks/Rewards -**

There  is currently lower gamma but growing OI as the volume has steadily  crept up over the past 5 days. This is what is causing the options to be  cheaper. Due to the low float it is likely to see significantly  increased volatility which will increase the IV on the options. You can  see evidence of the low float with the price action between yesterday  and today relative to the low volume. Today $INDI is up 10% yet the IV  has barely moved up by 11% to the 60% range on the October calls with an  expected movement of $1.2 in either direction. The main risk is a  smaller gamma ramp, but given the MMs do not seem to be hedging  properly, I think this acts as a solid ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù play.

A  lot of people ignored VLTA because it had a ""high float"" of 10,277,713  shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to  IRNT (\~1.3m), TMC (\~2.7m), OPAD (\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But  there's also a significant amount of OI to make up for and like we all  know, what really matters for gamma is the ratio of OI to float. So  currently, if we take the redemption proceeds and current float data  from Ortex, we can calculate the following:

**Float Calculation (Approximate):**

$400M Proceeds - **40M Shares Proceeds**

96M Shares \* 5274% Free Float = **50.76M Shares**

~~**Final Float: 50.76M - 40M = 10.76M Shares Free**~~

UPDATE: as u/kft99 pointed out, the actual float is as following:

>The deal was supposed to raise $495M, and it merged before the high SPAC redemption era (merged in June), so I assume the redemptions were minimal. So PIPE+trust=49.5M shares (PIPE unlock is already done).

So **FINAL FLOAT: 49.5M**. Not as small, but still a decent play. I think for a deSpac it‚Äôs large but for a regular stock, this is still a small float.

# The Implied Vol

Why  isn‚Äôt IV on IRNT as high as other deSPAC stocks? Let‚Äôs take a look at  other deSPACs that have been popular on reddit and compare INDI‚Äôs IV to  theirs:

**INDI IV is around 65% for ATM options.**

* GENI, IV \~100%
* AMC, IV \~130%
* BKSY, IV \~140%
* VLTA, IV \~150%
* IRNT, IV \~200%
* RKLY, IV \~220%
* SDC, IV \~250%
* TMC, IV \~250%

INDI  10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \~65% IV right now. Even further  OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \~100%. This is still a low IV compared to  ATM options on the other deSPACs. Most plays like $VLTA also had a  higher IV before the play was known of.

**For  INDI, high price acceleration is not currently priced in, which again,  does not make sense considering INDI shares the same properties as many  other deSPACS mentioned. Given retail movement and most other deSpac  plays getting hedge preemptively by MMs, this one seems to have flown  under their radar, but not mine.**

# Order Flow & SI Stats:

The  past few weeks have shown very strong buying pressure. Today INDI  currently sits at over an 8% gain. Since August, INDI is up about 30%.  Options flows are also very strong, with volume picking up drastically  on October calls.

Looking at Ortex, **we see SI of about 2.78M, which means SI % of float is about 26%.**

**Additionally, there is a 56% utilization rate, indicating a skew towards INDI being heavily shorted.**

I have tagged [u/pennyether](https://www.reddit.com/u/pennyether/) in the comments so that he can potentially provide Gamma Ramp statistics that are key to this play.

# Positions:

So how do I trade this? Like all trades, this has risk. However, based on  the data, it is highly likely that the rewards outweigh the risks. With  the current price action we are seeing in deSPACs, INDI is a very smart  bet, especially considering INDI is up 8% today and has decent gamma,  yet IV did not change. For that reason, current positions are a mix of  shares and options. INDI has a strong core business model, which  suffices the shares. For the technical deSPAC trade, options provide a  massive risk:reward.

**BlackBerry has earnings coming up this Wednesday, September 22nd after the market close, and there has been speculation from RBC Equity Research that the patent settlement/details could be announced.**

[RBC Equity Research](https://preview.redd.it/u8c9mp5kovo71.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=be29bb850a6833f65987bcce09b4d81d6a552aa5)

**On top of this, IAM media outlook who is a legit and fairly accurate media outlet specializing in Intellectual Property (and who first broke news about the BlackBerry Patent sales earlier in 2021) said in August 2021 the announcement is likely close and could be announced towards the end of September 2021, which is now (see below for the article):**

""Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry‚Äôs patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It‚Äôs almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry‚Äôs 38,000-strong portfolio of patents ‚Äúrelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies‚Äù, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these ‚Äì or the many other stories doing the rounds ‚Äì are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month (September 2021), closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note ‚Äì the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

Famous last words!""

Lucid definitely has a lot of experience in this field to create great drive train and batteries that are more efficient than Tesla. Lucid has 500+ miles EPA registered car. This is the highest miles compared to the other EV cars in the industry. As the matter of fact, TOP 5 EPA highest mileage registered cars are from Lucid.

You have AFRM going to the moon, SQ buying AfterPay, Klarna, PYPL buying Paidy, GS buying GSKY etc. Even MQ is joining the party.

But Discover Financial ($DFS) will be the first major credit card network to go BNPL on all their merchants. As most of us are aware, $DFS has always been one of those large traditional banking companies, and the large banks are starting to feel the pressure from BNPL encroaching on their domain. 

They mentioned back in February that they were partnering with Sezzle (one of the second-tier BNPLs) and looking into launching a BNPL offering. In this [Nilson Report](https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1369/sezzle/) about Sezzle (that has been relatively obscure), we can see that they are trying to add a BNPL solution for all their US Enterprise Clients on the Discover Global Network. Enterprise clients refer to all the giant chain-stores. 

Then in July, they invested a [further $30M into Sezzle](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/discover-backs-sezzle-with-30m-to-offer-shoppers-buy-now-pay-later-tool/). As Sezzle is currently listed on the ASX, the announcement was made there instead of at DFS.

Now if negotiations go smoothly, which I imagine they are, then Discover could become one of the largest BNPL providers in the US, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with Affirm's offering, on top if its current financial services. I think this full BNPL transition announcement could be made soon, though we can only speculate at this point.",24,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28dae4be0>

237,psjp2c,1632234041.0,a3gcdrz9,BFLO-Retail,How to short SPY with Synthetic Short Shares Credit Spread,"What are SPY synthetic short shares?? (and why should you love them?)


A synthetic short spread involves buying a Put option ATM or near the money, Selling a Call Options ATM or NTM, And buying a call option deep OTM so your broker limits your margin requirements.

Example:   SPY @435

Buy $430 Put SPY 

Sell $438 Call SPY

Buy $460 Call SPY


This trade will provide about a $20-30 credit (money that lands in your account upfront) üí∏üí∏.  

If share price rises Max Loss is $460-438 x 100 = $2200 per contract

If share price falls max gain is $430 x 100 = $43,000 per contract (this will only happen if America falls into total Mad Max economic ruin)

Good trading Bears!

240,psis16,1632231070.0,8gow0rqf,ASpicySpicyMeatball,Evergrande - thoughts from an ex hedge fund analyst,"There‚Äôs been a million questions about the Evergrande risk of default and whether it represents a systemic risk to China equity markets that could spill into ours via contagion. I‚Äôll give you my thoughts as someone who has spent their career as an investment professional in both hedge fund land and as a private equity investor (current job).

The first thing to recognize is that China operates very differently ‚Äî their government‚Äôs motives aren‚Äôt based on economic prosperity like Western governments‚Ä¶it‚Äôs control. Look no further than how they were willing to shoot their entire big tech industry in the gut to bring it to heel under the party‚Äôs control.

So what happens I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but the actions taken will be whatever maximizes party control. I personally think that‚Äôs quasi-nationalization.

If they let it default it will pose the risk of very rough contagion to their financial system, especially within debt cpaital markets which could lead to liquidity and short-term financing concerns, etc. that would eventually require monetary intervention. China doesn‚Äôt care much about a business going under‚Ä¶it cares about those risks to the financial system that in turn pose political risk to the party.

The market (or at least the buyside) has been expecting / talking about this for a while and yesterday was in my opinion a more behaviorally based knee jerk reaction. We‚Äôve been overdue for a 5-10% correction (based on historic patterns which I realize aren‚Äôt necessarily predictive of the future) so this feels like a good excuse to initiate selling waves which becomes self fulfilling. That's not to say there's no risk of a further slide and I'm not calling a bottom, but it does present an opportunity to start dollar cost averaging your way in.

If you want to know how this plays out the best thing you can do is look towards historic precedent for over leveraged businesses in China that pose risks to the system. In the case of HNA, for example, the playbook was to essentially take over the business and cut lose debt where they don‚Äôt care about the relationship and pay off those who they do care about. So someone like HSBC would be fine whereas a smaller foreign bank may get burnt. Any large international a bank is important enough that the party is going to make them whole, (or close to it), mitigating concerns for systemic contagion. And the quantum of debt is not too much of a dent to China‚Äôs balance sheet, especially compared to the money printing that‚Äôs gone on for covid stimulus.

While the only person who truly knows what will happen policy-wise is Xi himself, based on historic precedent I think the outcome will be more favorable than the market is pricing. Personally I am going to buy in on what I think is an overreaction and a lot of market noise where people have been looking for an excuse to sell off. The selling yesterday was actually very orderly and you saw a lot of institutions unwind their hedges (buying back their covered calls). And new option volume did not suggest the market is now incrementally more bearish. 

EDIT: Adding link to a piece by Michael Pettis who (I think) succinctly explains the risk + regulatory quandry and how he estimates it will play out. I agree with his points and a lot of sellside reports have been predicting a similar outcome for a bit now. This is to say I am not re-inventing the wheel with this perspective, merely pointing towards how institutions and leading academics are thinking about the situation to try to cut through some of the misinformation I've seen posted (on both sides of the coin).

Link: https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/85391

Tl;dr:
- The key is to understand which constituencies within evergrande‚Äôs debt burden China cares about keeping happy and how much debt those they don‚Äôt care about have on their balance sheets
- Yesterday was an overreaction but selling was calm and orderly (not a panic) and many people took out their downside hedges (i.e. buying to close on covered calls, selling their long puts, etc...a bullish signal)
- The market and smart money has known about this for a long time. Don‚Äôt panic and hand them alpha (i.e. Covid crash in 2020)",421,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28dc47a00>

In May of this year Discovery Inc. and WarnerMedia (part of AT&T group as of now) are set to merge in mid 2022. Discovery stock series C (ticker DISCK) is looking like a very good buying opportunity as discovery shareholders are to receive 29% of the new company. From what I know, DISCA and DISCK (basically have different voting rights) will both receive 1 to 1 shares in the new company (not 100% about DISCB), yet DISCK is trading cheaper right now because DISCA has more voting rights. Basically, the different series represent different voting rights which will be irrelevant after the merger.

# Theory

**Michael Burry**

In Q2 2021 Michael Burry added \~855,000 shares of $DISCK at around $29 to his portfolio, this represents \~18% of his portfolio (excluding cash and options). This adds to my confidence in the potential of this company, it isn't wise to assume it's a good investment just because someone bought it, although Michael Burry is definitely a very intelligent person and knows exactly what he is doing, he tends to bet big when he is very confident and $25,000,000 in $DISCK is a pretty good indicator of his confidence. He predicted the GFC and failure of MBS in 2007-2008, he read thousands of papers regarding the mortgages, so he does his research.

&#x200B;

**Potential**

Since the announcement of the merger on May 17 $DISCK is down approx. 20%. As of writing this it is trading at around $25 a share. I am going to mostly avoid talking about valuations in this post as I believe it is quite hard to put an exact value on it right now because of the plethora of factors that contribute to its valuation. At the beginning of this year Discovery released its streaming service Discovery+ which amassed 15 million subscribers quite quickly and currently has 18 million. There seems to be quite a big, and underestimated, potential after the merge. They are expected to generate $14B EBITDA and \~$8.4B FCF in the first year after the merge, 2023. Additionally, there is a synergy target of $3B (additional cash flow resulting from merger alone). Discovery+ has only launched in 3 countries and is expected to grow a lot more as they expand out. WarnerMedia's HBO Max is also growing, they currently have a combined subscriber count of 85 million and they are projected to have around 200 million by around 2025 from the information I gathered. The streaming potential is too difficult to ignore, ""Discovery is the undisputed leader in nonfiction and lifestyle programming."" Once the merger is complete, their combined networks and media groups should appeal to many different age groups and demographics. David Zaslav (CEO of Discovery) said that they will be spending around $20B on content together.

Discovery's DTC (Direct To Consumer) model looks to be very strong, as they are selling and reselling content on their streaming service but also cable TV.

[$DISCK Price YTD as of 21\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/pz3ary1nxuo71.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ced80d07097a4daffd32726091032139496f24)

&#x200B;

**Archegos & Stock dip in March**

As I'm sure all of you know Bill Hwang had to liquidate his positions in many companies in March, one of them which he had a substantial position in, was $DISCK. That is why the price plummeted earlier this year if you were curious.

&#x200B;

**Legacy & Cable TV**

The cable TV industry and regular networks have been slowing down with the rise of streaming services that offer everything at your fingertips for a low price. I do believe Discovery and WarnerMedia will be able to stay on top of this and make up for their slowing Cable TV businesses with their new streaming services and content production.

&#x200B;

**Financials & Ratios**

Here you can look at their financials over the past 5 years - [https://app.tikr.com/stock/financials?cid=22666093&tid=49031561&ref=7zd58z](https://app.tikr.com/stock/financials?cid=22666093&tid=49031561&ref=7zd58z)

They are currently trading at a PE of 15x.

&#x200B;

**Debt**

One of the biggest concerns regarding these media companies and the merger as a whole is the debt. Discovery will contribute \~$15B and WarnerMedia \~$43B in debt to the new company. This is definitely a substantial amount of debt. They will be producing a lot of cash flow, yet the question is will they be able to cover the debt even if interest rates rise? I am interested to see your opinions. I had a look at AT&T and Discovery's annual reports and at the debt payments required over the next 5 years, it does not look so troublesome compared to the amount of cash they are producing even if the interest rate goes up to let's say, 5%. But I would definitely like to hear more from others as to whether they are at risk or not.

As addressed in their merger presentation, they will be targeting ""rapid deleveraging"" going from 5x EBIDTA to 3x EBIDTA within 24 months and have a long-term goal of 2.5-3x.

The (debt) deal will include a $31.5B bridge, $10B in term loans and a $6B credit line. ""Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan won the prized mandate to lead a $47.5 billion funding effort, and have now spread the financing among 20 of its peers on Wall Street, according to bankers familiar with the deal"". *Source: Insider*

# Conclusion

It looks like the market is undervaluing the potential of this new company which will arise in 2022. There are many worries regarding debt, profitability and the success of the new business. Although I believe it is being underestimated and $DISCK shares are selling pretty cheap right now. I've looked at other options including $DISCA, $DISCB and $T but $DISCK looks like the best value.

Well, this is both. The Evergrande situation will -I'm 99% sure- not impact the world economy any time soon. There are contagion strategies put in place to avoid stuff like that. The feds learned a whole lot of stuff ever since 2008. This is so different. And If you think that China is dumb enough to let their economy get fucked rn, after all the work they put in to Ensure that they're numbah 1... You're in for a surprise, cause the Chinese are kinda smart. 

The only reason I haven't bought stock options myself is because all my money is already all tied up. But yours might be not.

Last year this same container cost $7k. 

Along with this the booking time on these containers has drastically increased. 

A perfect storm is brewing folks. Bottom line cost have skyrocketed at the global supply chain level. Transit times has increased drastically. 

The effects of this are to be seen by early December. Companies, especially small businesses are going to struggle big time to import goods.

I like all these platforms that give us the small guys the platform to play at a level same as wallstreet guys","I watched Jim Chanos interview via CNBC yesterday. Been awhile to have seen him on CNBC and yesterday was a day when us equities weren't doing too well yesterday. This gave Jim Chanos a well known bear to have enough facetime to talk... Well isn't it fantastic when he took the opportunity to hint that he is short selling trading aka fintech platform from China like that of Futu.

For me, I have enjoyed using the trading platform as this provides me with the opportunity to try to play a level field with the wallstreet guys since the platform is a low commission fee platform (they don't sell trading flow but instead charge low trading fee in Asia like Singapore, Malaysia etc). Can't believe that due to these shortsellers, Tiger Brokers and Futu have become so cheap in terms of relative pricing... this wall Street shortseller against such platform... I am particularly disappointed on how they want to deprive me such an opportunity. I have decided to add on some small positions in tiger brokers after his interview.

Will I be right? I don't know but I am disappointed on how they don't want a level playing field for Tiger Brokers and Futu, which has sizeable number of users in Singapore, etc. Watch 4 minutes 15 seconds onwards and you know how this incomplete picture is. futu and Tiger do not only have Chinese users from China. I am from Singapore and almost half of the paying users from Tiger is at least from outside China based on my estimate

What happened today was a classic overreaction due to Evergrande and their housing debt crisis and had in no way anything to do with the American market.

The next week it rose back to ATH and ended the week near $440. I predict the same thing will happen here and put us back at $450 by the end of September.

How Low earth orbit, 5g and beamforming will harden your GPS.","*The following is not financial advice. It is analysis. This post will just cover a single use case  not presented elsewhere. So the post does NOT provide a comprehensive analysis of the company. It has just a brief overview of the concept of the main company, does not mention the subsidiary, and focuses on the *unconfirmed* use case captioned. 

*TL/DR: They‚Äôre building the skynet, to make your GPS rigid.

The AST SpaceMobile Network 

* AST SpaceMobile space segment is planned to consist of 336 satellites by 2028 and the initial application is for 243 satellites operating in sixteen orbital planes in low earth orbit on altitudes between 725 and 740 km.

* Phased deployment 
-First 18 (+2 spares) covering 49 equatorial countries. This part is financed.
-Then expanding north to cover Europe and continental USA, and south to cover all of Africa and South America with the global constellation of 68 satellites. 
-Later (early 2024) Increasing to 110 for MIMO functionality. MIMO means a Phone can talk to several sats. 4x4 MIMO is in chip Qualcomm x65 manufactured by AST partner Samsung. (In androids from early 2022). This is 3GPP release 16 5g standard.
-Finally adding more satellites - 336 total - for more capacity and increased robustness producing 6 satellites per month.

* The satellite. Bluebird type satellites are approx 20x17.8 meters wide and flat. Flying edge first. Capable of 2800 beams in cellular fronthaul bands using sandwiched solar panel/ phased array (electronically steered antenna) elements that is ~ 330 square meters on each satellite. Each of these beams produce a beam-cell on earth effectively replacing a cell tower, varying in diameter depending on bandwidth. The satellite will also be capable of several Q/V backhaul beams. Bluebirds use multiple magnetorquers and hall effect (ion) thrusters for redundant manouverability.

The worlds *largest* constellation.

*Antenna real estate: If launched as planned (they can launch up to 18 satellites on a Space-x Falcon heavy type vehicle) the 336 satellites will have (336x330) a total of 110,880 square meters of phased arrays deployed in space by 2028. AST SpaceMobile total array will be the size of Ellis Island. For ref Starlink sats has 1.7 sqm phased array antenna each. Starlink plans to launch the most *numerous* constellation 12,000 sats by mid 2020s or 20,400 sqm of phased array antenna. AST planned 5x that in size. 

* Ground segment is built and maintained mostly by partner companies American Tower and Vodafone group, it includes terrestrial switches that has multiple gateways with motor steered higly directive ~5 meter long yagi type Q and V band Very high throughput antennas. Which connects the backhaul from satellite to partner networks using internet and legacy cellular networks. They slice capacity using Altiostar/Rakuten AI-software virtualising the entire network incl. handsets to optimize latency and throughput. 

Previously advertised functionality: Coms.

*The company has advertised 2g,3g,4g,5g and IoT functionality. Notably the DSS functionality of 3GPP rel 15-16 makes 4g LTE and 5g possible in the same cells on the same bands. It is bent pipe architecture so forward compatible with 6g. This will eventually be supplied globally and available in most countries from standard cellphones through B2B agreements with terrestrial mobile network operators, MNO on their spectrum. Agreements are signed with MNOs covering 1.5 Bn subscribers/customers.

Not previously advertised functionality: Spoof and jam proof PNT.

* GPS Background: The GPS system was developed to give the US military an edge. It is a MEO system. 31 satellites orbit the earth twice a day. 20,200 km up. 28 times the altitude of AST SpaceMobile constellation. As signal strength decrease with the square of the distance this factor explains a difference of 28^2 = 784 times weaker signal than SpaceMobile constellation. Jamming and spoofing of this weak signal is now in the skill set of US adversaries, while they have launched PNT constellations of their own. The proliferation of GNSS/spoofing and jamming capabilities is blunting the US edge. GPS is not only a deterrant that has deteriorated. Meanwhile the civil society and the military has become increasingly dependent on GPS type PNT, making it very vulnerable to spoofing and jamming. What was a strength is now a weakness.

* Beamforming and encrypted PNT. Beamforming is a technique by which the signal strength is increased in a certain direction. This can be electronically steered without changing nadir of the satellite.
So by the extreme beamforming (0.75 degree beams) capability of AST SpaceMobile satellites the difference in signal strength will be much higher than the 784 times just explained by shorter distance. Making AST-PNT jam resistant. Add to this the 5g high bandwidth information carrying and encryption capability of the AST-signals and AST-PNT becomes spoof-resistant.

* Five signs that hardened PNT is pursued by AST:

1). A LEO PNT patent by the CEO:  https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/21/02/c4/4ae76f6181b025/WO2021163040A1.pdf

2). An application to FCC filed by general manager of AST Midland Texas facility for a terrestrial Space station that includes an specialised restricted device to receive GPS signals outdoors and retransmit them indoors.

3). 3GPP release 16 5g standard, which will be inside phones from early 2022, includes this [*AST will thus provide PNT as it is now part of 5g*]. A range of positioning methods, are used: DL-based positioning is supported by a new reference signal called the positioning reference signal (PRS), UL-based positioning is based on release 15 sounding reference signals (SRSs) with release 16 extensions, time is used in round-trip time (RTT) based positioning schemes. All that needs to function well everywhere is AST SpaceMobile global constellation MIMO to triangulate.

4). The low cost. The cost in terms of used beams and bandwidths has been estimated in an academic paper on fused LEO GNSS. It uses only a small fraction (less than 1%) of the constellation capacity. Video of author explaining it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cGlSTo8cDuA the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12334

5) Accuracy, this will increase (see paper above) to cm level facilitating new use cases like precision farming and precision drone control expanding customer base v/s legacy GPS.

Valuation 

*Hardened PNT restores the edge of trillion dollar weapon systems while making the civilian society resilient to foreign powers.
That is hard to value. The proper way imo is the alternative cost of launching a dedicated constellation for just this purpose v/s using a fraction of AST capacity to accomplish it. Needless to say the SpaceMobile dual use constellation would provide more satellites and thus greater redundancy and precision compared to a dedicated constellation. But half the cost  of dedicated constellation is a fair price.

*The ground control system of GPS III costs in excess of 4 billion USD. The GPS III satellites cost .5 Bn each initially with .2 Bn projected for the last. 

*The estimated cost of the GPS III space segment through the first eight satellites was $4.4 billion. These use M-code to counter spoofing and somewhat increased signal strength to decrease effect of jamming. There are 31 sats. Using the lower number we get a $6.2 Bn space segment cost. 

*The above sums to a total cost exceeding $10Bn of the GPS III system. The capability of an future AST SpaceMobile constellation of doing this better should be at least half that cost $5Bn ~ $27 per share.

*ASTS market cap today is ~$2.1 Bn or $11.56 per share. 

Conclusion

*The valuation above is indicating an 2x upside on accomplishing dual use PNT functionality, alone. 

*This PNT dual use, which follows more or less automatically from 3GPP release16 5g standard, seems not to be priced in at current levels.

Final note 

*No official or unofficial company source has mentioned plans for this PNT dual use case outlined above. It is all my own logic presented, based on open sources. The confirmed main use case - cellular connectivity - from a technological and regulatory perspective has been the main focus of my DD. To the extent that it will not fit in a single post. But my DD on the PNT potential is shallow enough to do so.",205,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28efe70a0>

287,ps5fto,1632177019.0,ebmb73rj,Turbulent_Dog_628,"The Big Dipper: A bull case for GREE, the #1 most-shorted stock","Disclaimer: not financial advice, I‚Äôm literally retarded, bla bla bla. Also, mods, I mention cr\*pto in this post, but not in the context of shilling some POS cr\*ptocurrency, but rather in the context of an equity ($GREE) that mines cr\*pto. 

Okay retards, time for your daily lesson in buying the dip.

Greenidge Generation ($GREE) currently trades at around $30. Based on the way its recent merger was structured, this equates to roughly $3.45 pre-merger pricing. Pre-merger pricing was recently as high as $60. So, this is approximately a 94% decline. Just since the merger, $GREE has dropped 70%. Which brings me to my first point‚Ä¶

1. This dip is unjustified.

IMO, a 94% decline is absurd and represents a great buying opportunity. We‚Äôve seen massive post-pump dips in the likes of $GME, $AMC, etc., and buying these dips would make you a wealthy autist indeed. (Not comparing $GREE to $GME, $AMC, etc., but providing a couple memorable examples of secondary pumps.)

Why the big dip, you ask? IMO, this is mostly due to a combination of scared bulls selling at a loss and institutional shorts terrorizing the stock (and today had macro factors at play obviously). Which brings me to my second point‚Ä¶

2. $GREE has overwhelming short interest (#1 most-shorted stock now).

If you've been following the stock, this shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. It appears that there are some shorts with very deep pockets trying to hold this stock down. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) ranks $GREE as the #1 most-shorted U.S. stock, with short interest at 68.36%. Frankly, if I were a betting man (I‚Äôm not, I hate money), I would bet the percentage is even higher now - $GREE seems to have attracted a lot of new shorts in the past few days.

3. $GREE is a cr\*pto play. Cr\*pto = üìàüìàüìà

Lots of investors (retail and institutional) want exposure to cr\*pto, but don‚Äôt necessarily want to partake in the Wild West*‚Ñ¢* of cr\*pto trading.

If investors want exposure to cr\*pto, but instead want to partake in the Temperate and Hospitable East‚Ñ¢ of U.S. equity options trading*,* B\*tcoin mining stocks like $GREE are a great alternative. In general, this space has performed quite well. In the past year, $MARA has gone up 1,693.12%. $RIOT has surged 839.59%. (In the same timeframe, $B\*C increased only 300%). 

$GREE appears to be an especially interesting play for cr\*pto mining. $GREE is significantly expanding its mining capabilities: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-b\*tcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-bitcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15) Furthermore, from the article: ""The addition of 10,000 new miners is an important step in our commitment to expand our fully carbon-neutral capacity.‚Äù Emphasis on ‚Äúcarbon-neutral‚Äù: as we‚Äôve seen, the environmental implications of B\*tcoin mining have been catalysts for big moves in the cr\*pto markets, so this makes $GREE an attractive play.

For additional evidence, see here: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/). When Sphere 3D announced news about its merger partner receiving equipment for carbon-neutral cr\*pto mining, it popped 26%; yet $GREE saw the same news, on the same day (September 15), and dropped like a rock.

As always, do your own DD. I see lots of bulls on message boards that are pretty pessimistic, likely due to large paper losses that seem to grow each day (may also just be bashers pretending to be bulls). Personally, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see $GREE rebound, likely above its merger price of $102, which would still represent an 81% discount from the peak. The shorts seem quite overextended.

To be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.

Although the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. 

1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will ""help"" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . 

2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods üôÑ)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. 

3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. & furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already üò¨) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. 


I'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. 

And technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I‚Äôm also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! 

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

 [Why I think a SPX high soon is possible. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p08vzd/why_i_think_a_spx_high_soon_is_possible/) 

A break under the 161 fib support (4150). 

 

>When a market makes a big break of these 161 levels it is usually with news. Big news. Unexpected news. Maybe the aliens shutting off the internet or something. IDK. But watch out for news and a sharp break of the 161 (4,140 price level). I'm not saying it would definitely be the start of the crash, just saying a lot of crashes started like that.

&#x200B;

SPX needs to downtrend Sept. 

Get under 4200. 

Rally to retest 4200 for the sell entry.

Just look at this [tweet](https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439635649771065352) from Katmai National Park yesterday. This is clearly a warning, possibly from agents gone rouge in Alaska letting us know that from September 29th to October 2nd, we will be in ""Fat Bear Week"". As we all know, fat bears can only happen when the market is crashing. This is clear evidence that the NPS is currently engaged in market manipulation to make as many rich bears as possible before the end of next week. Furthermore, in other [tweets](https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439680697573257222) they talk about how some bears act as pirates and steal other bear's fish! This clearly shows that all bears will make enough money to survive winter, but as usual larger ""institutional"" bears will make even more money!

I think we need to applaud the bravery of these park rangers who are risking their lives exposing this incredible fraud. I had thought the Department of the Interior would be less nefarious than this, but clearly they cannot be trusted. I only hope that the rangers who gave us this important information can safely escape into the Alaskan wilderness and avoid being eaten by bears.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: Fat bears for 2 weeks

&#x200B;

Edit: As was pointed out in the comments, the NPS likely has motive to destroy all US industry. Companies having less money means they buy less land, which can eventually be turned into more National Parks.

POSCO is a major world steel producer that derives 35% of it's direct export revenues from China (construction and auto being major industries it supplies). It's exposure to China is actually far greater due to all the suppliers it sells to that are exposed to China (Samsung appliances, LG, Hyundai, Kia, heavy machinery and equipment etc.). 

>Export sales and overseas sales to customers abroad: **61.4% of our total revenue**  
>  
>Export sales to customers in Asia, including China: **65.5% of our total export sales revenue**   
>  
>**Export sales to China**: **35.8% of our total export sales** **revenue**

the $PKX ADR trades here, but the primary listing is in Asia. Korean, Tokyo, and Shanghai markets are closed for holidays today, meaning the selloff hasn't been fully processed there yet. Looking at this, Korean market is closed until Thursday. Shanghai will be closed Sept 20, and Sept 21, so they are opening Wednesday. Tokyo markets are closed Sept 20 and Sept 23.

So, Asian markets haven't had a chance to massacre Posco yet, **IV is still low**, stock hasn't dipped nearly as much as other international steel producers like $MT and $TX today. 

Positions: November and October $70 puts

# POSCO Overview - the risks they've highlighted:

6th largest world steel producer, and the largest steel producer based in Korea. Most of their revenues come from exports to places like China for the auto and construction industries. When China needs quality structural steel, they turn to importers like POSCO.

They're worried about China

Public companies are required to report the genuine risk factors that could significantly negatively impact their business. Guess what the risk factor at the tippity top of the list is on POSCO's annual filing? You guessed it: CHINA:

>From time to time, these industries have experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns, which in turn have negatively impacted our steel business. Global economic conditions have deteriorated in recent years, with global financial and capital markets experiencing substantial volatility ... Such developments have also been caused by, and continue to be exacerbated by, among other things, the  üö© **slowdown of economic growth in China** üö©  and other major emerging market economies ... as well as a deterioration in economic and trade relations between the United States and its major trading partners,  üö© **particularly China** üö© . 

# Why are they so worried about China?

Again, they lay it out for us nice and easy, China is THE largest source of export revenues

>***We rely on export sales for a significant portion of our total sales. Adverse economic and financial developments in Asia in the future may have an adverse effect on demand for our products in Asia***   
>  
>Export sales and overseas sales to customers abroad: **61.4% of our total revenue**  
>  
>Export sales to customers in Asia, including China: **65.5% of our total export sales revenue**   
>  
>**Export sales to China**: **35.8% of our total export sales** **revenue**  
>  
>Economic weakness in Asia may also adversely affect our sales to the Korean companies that export to the region, especially companies in the **construction, shipbuilding, automotive, electrical appliances and downstream steel processing industries.** Weaker demand in these countries, combined with an increase in global production capacity, may also reduce export prices  

So not only are they directly exposed to china for 35% of export sales, all the appliance / auto / tertiary industries that buy their products in Korea could see hits from China and also impact POSCO (think Samsung appliances, LG Electronics / Appliances, Hyundai, Kia, Machinery companies...)

[CHINA by far the most important steel export region for POSCO](https://preview.redd.it/56z0jq0v6po71.jpg?width=1657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=548f313be4946efdd5673aaad59b22714bf6db84)

On top of this China has overproduced steel:

>In recent years, a slowdown in domestic demand for steel products in China resulting from slowed economic growth as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with an expansion in steel production capacity, has led to production over-capacity in the Chinese steel 

This has resulted in a dramatic reduction of China steel needs. Steel in this region is mostly made using blast furnaces and iron ore, well, just take a look at Iron Ore Prices, down 8% today alone, cratered over the past month to prices lower than 1 year ago:

[IRON ORE is CRATERING - CHINA NOT MAKING\/USING STEEL like they were](https://preview.redd.it/ewe9q0o18po71.jpg?width=1499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048004bf388d2ff1eebf41bd5bfabead07fe554a)

# Lastly, as we all know by now, the Evergrande situation doesn't look great for construction in China [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58579833](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58579833)

>There are several reasons why Evergrande's problems are serious.  
>  
>Firstly, many people bought property from Evergrande even before building work began. They have paid deposits and could potentially lose that money if it goes bust.  
>  
>There are also the companies that do business with Evergrande. **Firms including construction and design firms and materials suppliers are at risk of incurring major losses, which could force them into bankruptcy.**

 John Chen Yeah, that‚Äôs a good question. So, our Spark platform is composed of UEM and UES. And UEM is very strategic to us because it is our gateway to a lot of our major customers who are completely relying on us on security. So, our strategy is to continue to expand our footprint in the regulated industry. And where the market is more price-sensitive in the non-regulated industries, we ***want to make sure that our UES platform, which is our endpoint security platform, connects to run on one of the largest install bases outside of regulated ‚Äì i.e. Microsoft Intune.

What‚Äôs a SPAC-alackin, ya bunch of Mongols. Seriously, you guys have been barreling through the gates of high SPAC redemption this last month. IRNT? Did it. TMC? Got it. OPAD? Get it. So what else is on the menu‚Ä¶? How about some easy peasy S. P. I. R. squeezy.

There‚Äôs a million SPACs to squeeze, so‚Ä¶ why this one? Let‚Äôs start here, LIQUIDITY. The average daily volume over the last 5 days is only 2.3mm (115%) for SPIR‚Ä¶ whereas IRNT is 28.3mm (2,200% float), TMC 18.7mm (690% float), and OPAD 29.4mm (860% float). I mean‚Ä¶ the volume was only 0.67mm on Friday before the pump. Um‚Ä¶ say liquidity squeeze anyone? SPIR is so illiquid that DFV could squeeze this as a side hustle. Seriously, the capital required needs no hedgie (although we are accepting applications).

**Company**

Spire Global (SPIR) owns a ton of satellites that provide data and analytics for maritime, aviation, and weather purposes. That have several levels of subscriptions to provide. Their subscriptions are growing but‚Ä¶ they lose money. For this play, we are all about the technicals so I won‚Äôt spend time on fundamentals. Let‚Äôs talk tech.

**Liquidity Squeeze**

As noted above, this thing is so illiquid that you might wanna turn the bottle upside down. Plenty of other tickers have low float but only this one is a ghost town.

The total Class A shares outstanding is 134mm, most is locked up with insiders, institutions, and PIPE investors. The 23mm initial shares had 21mm redeemed (91%), leaving only 1.98mm shares for an effective initial float. For comparison, IRNT is 1.3mm, TMC 2.7mm, and OPAD 3.4mm.

&#x200B;

[\(Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float\)](https://preview.redd.it/khx5eqnpwoo71.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e2fa35254f7b24e163b8bd4788ee975d66b0dd)

(Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float)

According to the 8-K, the company must file for PIPE registration (S-1) within 45 days of the closing of the merger. The PIPE will account for an additional 24.5MM so‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not over stay our welcome. The merger closed 8/16/21 so the deadline to submit the S-1 is by (or before) 9/30/21. As of Friday (9/17), no S-1 has been filed.

The timeline for EFFECT filing is variable but is typically 1-2 weeks after the S-1 is filed. Therefore, the potential timeline for PIPE is anywhere from 9/27 to 10/15. Once the PIPE is fully registered, all bets are off. The other investors are subject to a lock up for at least 60 days from closing (8/16/21). So for at least the next week, we stay squeezy.

**Short Squeeze**

Shorts have been priming this over the last several weeks. SI now amounts to an estimated 1.05mm shares or 53% SI of the current available float of 1.98mm. There are no shares to borrow from IBKR or Fidelity and I‚Äôd be willing to bet that‚Äôs the same for other brokerages.

The average estimated short cost basis is $10.48. As of close Friday (9/17), shorts are at an estimated 30% average loss and we‚Äôre just getting started.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5k83iv7yoo71.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfff2208b505f4b45a0d4153609e17ca2bba43d

The utilization has been at 100% and the cost of borrow is currently at 78% (ortex), 65% (IBKR), and 25% (Fidelity). the SI exceeds on loan by 78% which may indicate naked shorting. After all, if MMs have hedged the float but you degenerates keep buying, they gotta sell the fake shares.

**Gamma Squeeze**

The option chain has been getting jacked over the last month. It‚Äôs pretty insane due to the low float. Based on the OI reporting for 9/17 options on Friday, 0.8mm shares are tied to ITM contracts (net delta between ITM calls and puts). We‚Äôre talking 40% of the float if exercised. 

In total, the call OI for 9/17 expiration was 15,134 but‚Ä¶ the remaining call OI for all other expirations is still 37,532 (48% which is tied to 10/15). The chain could get pumped further if call buying post-quad witching builds steam on Monday. After all, this is just getting started.

Option surface plots across all expirations:

Call OI is tearing upwards while we see with our microscope that the puts are pretty pathetic. MMs are delta hedged to the tits but what about that sexy gamma ramp? How is hedging going to change as price rockets (per OI; per BSM):

https://preview.redd.it/t0cyq7dcyoo71.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01556816e3fba7179356d041851fefcd541eb14e

(Note the x-axis for this graph is NOT strike, it is the actual stock price as it moves)

The price has been trading in the $7.5 - $12.5 range since deSPAC, requiring theoretical hedging anywhere from 0 - 150% of float. But‚Ä¶ the hedging becomes insane above $12.5. On Friday, we saw the effect. The price broke up towards $15 before settling at close at $13.71. This price action required 150-200% float delta hedge‚Ä¶ wow. If this break up above $20, the hedging blows above 250%. This is no joke and if the option chain continues to build, the gamma ramp will only get more psychotic.

**Reading the tea leaves in the Charts**

There were bullish signals this last Thursday (9/16) and Friday (9/17). Thursday, we saw a bearish reversal candle. Based on other squeezes, this can be a signal of a bear trap before a breakout, just like we‚Äôve seen with so many other friends:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jxuoxyneyoo71.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2827395175e320ff079ceb8c6180f2d93b1c10b

Remember when everyone bailed on IRNT at like $25? Um‚Ä¶ bear trap guys. Stage was set on Thursday for SPIR just like it was for IRNT. 

On Friday, most SPACs were bleeding in sympathy with the fall of IRNT. However, midday, SPIR broke out from $10.70 up to $14.79. The price consolidated towards lower volume, curled up, then broke out again to finish the day at $13.71. Watching price action and the tape, there are signals a large player (or players) may by pushing. Since the ticker is so illiquid, it only takes a small volume of options activity to move. 

**Conclusion?**

This SPAC opportunity is unique due to liquidity issues. In addition, the short interest is maxed and the gamma ramp is stacked. With a little push (like Friday), this thing rockets.

DISCLOSURE: I am currently holding (210) $12.5, (50) $15, (50) $20, and (200) $25 10/15 calls

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD!

**TL;DR**

¬∑  SPIR produces data/info with satellites.

¬∑  Combination completed 8/16/21. 

¬∑  PIPE may go effective is 9/27 ‚Äì 10/15.

¬∑  1.98mm float w/ 1mm shorts (none left to borrow).

¬∑  Option chain is loaded with approximately 37,500 call OI AFTER 9/17. Delta hedging is stupidly high (250%+ of float) above $20.

¬∑  Chart includes a bullish signal of a bear trap via a fake bearish reversal candle (just like IRNT).

¬∑  Potential liquidity, short, and/or gamma squeeze possible with little capital required.",329,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2904f8d90>

***
     
So what changed?

***

# Background 

***

I caught wind of Evergrande before the wider public began losing its mind. I also did research on the Chinese Shadow Banking system (google it) in 2016-2017. Basically, China‚Äôs economy is one giant dumpster fire propped up by government intervention (kind of sounds like the US now huh?). 

***

Every dataset out of China is steaming garbage. The numbers are all made up to meet made up regulatory thresholds. The government hides default risk through constant intervention. Companies that seem strong are always propped up by stimulus behind the scenes. So Evergrande is really not much of a surprise. 

***

# Capital Controls

***

China has insane capital controls. As a result, there is little true US investment in China. Goldman Sachs and other big banks circumvent this somewhat by creating Chinese subsidiaries that are partially state-owned. Basically, the government ends up owning whatever US-based investment firm/enterprise you build in China. These capital controls essentially limited risk that US firms take on. Unless banks did some truly retarded shit (which is possible), then the contagion should be limited to their holdings (which appear to be limited). 


***

# Real Estate

***

As everyone knows, Chinese nationals love real estate. Evergrande blowing up with clearly force some wider sell offs as institutions try to deleverage. That‚Äôs expected. 

***

# REVERSE REPO

***

Now here‚Äôs the beauty of what JPOW did. The reverse repo facility acts as a sponge. I won‚Äôt go into details, but basically, it sucks up excess liquidity. The facility hit 1.2 TRILLION recently, meaning that instituions have so few asset buying opportunities that they rather park the cash at the Fed. This sponge will release liquidity when needed. If Evergrande truly isn‚Äôt bailed out, and there are liquidity ramifications in the US, it is my belief that this excess liquidity can more than cover any sort of shortfalls. 

***

Furthermore, I was a permabear because I saw tapering on the horizon. This will just prolong our money printing. 

***

TLDR: Evergrande might blow up, but we have enough liquidity to cover the partial fallout. BUY THE DIP!!!

A colder winter and soaring natural gas prices globally could lead to higher-than-expected [oil prices](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/) at the end of this year, with the potential for oil hitting $85 per barrel in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs says.

Goldman, which has a price forecast of $80 a barrel oil for the last quarter of 2021, believes that the natural gas crunch combined with a colder-than-usual winter in Europe and Asia could pose an upside risk of $5 a barrel to its Q4 price projection, the bank‚Äôs analysts said in a note on Sunday carried by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/soaring-gas-prices-colder-winter-could-boost-oil-prices-says-goldman-2021-09-20/?rpc=401&).

‚ÄúThe tightness in global gas supplies creates a clear and potentially meaningful bullish catalyst for the oil market this winter, larger than the downside risk to global oil demand from another Delta-like COVID wave,‚Äù the analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote.

According to the investment bank, oil demand could jump by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) if the coming winter is colder than usual in the northern hemisphere.

Europe‚Äôs tight gas market, low wind speeds, abnormally low gas inventories, and record carbon prices have combined in recent weeks to send benchmark gas prices on the continent and power prices in the largest economies to¬†[record highs](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Europes-Energy-Crisis-Worsens-As-Wind-Stops-Blowing.html). Record European natural gas prices are sending Asian spot prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) [to record levels](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Europes-Energy-Crisis-Is-Driving-Up-Natural-Gas-Prices-Worldwide.html) for this time of the year, too.

Last week, Bank of America Global Research said that oil prices [could hit $100](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Why-Bank-Of-America-Thinks-Oil-Prices-Are-Heading-To-100.html) per barrel over the next six months if we have a colder-than-usual winter, which could be the most important driver of global energy markets in the coming months. BofA sees upside for oil prices amid modest market deficits in the next few months. It also sees potential for oil to hit $100 a barrel earlier than its mid-2022 call from June if the winter is colder than normal.

344,prxojw,1632153320.0,bhhmmgui,JustAddaTM,Why Evergrande isn‚Äôt THAT big of a deal,"As many of you found out this morning, a Chinese real estate developer decided to go full Enron this morning and go completely tits up. But there has been an intense overreaction in the market to bad news that mostly impacts Chinese markets. 

Firstly, the Chinese government is not going to just allow them to go going under and let 300b in debt turn into nothing. 300b in debt is really a trillion in financial impacts as the lenders need to make up for losses, bankers have to replenish balance sheets, and the ripples of having unoccupied apartments and offices runs through the Chinese economy. The real estate market has been priming to burst in China now for years as entire towns go unoccupied (look that up). 

But then you have to ask, why does this effect American stonks? It shouldn‚Äôt, at least not materially. Manufacturing plants won‚Äôt close down, supply chains will continue to be effected by covid but not by a Chinese economy. The US economy is extremely strong compared to the world economy right now, and if China suffers all that means is our products become cheaper as supply of labor in China sky rockets with unemployment. 

Avoid US banks, as they will have large investments or loans within China as it is still a global economy to a degree, and companies with 30%+ sales to Southeast Asia. This shouldn‚Äôt be difficult as most of our exports to China is agriculture related, and they will continue to need food (maybe, who knows with the Chinese gov.) Otherwise, I would recommend waiting out the week as markets dip and then buy as much domestic stocks/options (11/5 calls would be a ideal as holiday buying begins and the democrats reconciliation bill will have been parsed down) as I possibly could as their will be an immediate and strong rebound within the market.

* I'm going to provide a brief overview of how a douchebag hedge fund analyst and his peers will quickly analyze $ASTS after missing out on $10-$20 of upside as the stock likely ramps heading into March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3
   * If you don't know much about $ASTS, there are several posts by [/u/thekookreport](https://www.reddit.com/u/thekookreport/) and [/u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/u/faisall1/) that cover the company in depth with varying degrees of humor

[Get ahead of these D-bags before Tendy Town](https://preview.redd.it/faccuf61eoo71.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=5474df97754da2492f2cb2ea4be11c5709943474)

 

**Assembling Financial Projections:**

* After getting yelled at by their bigger douchebag Portfolio Manager (""PM"") for missing part of the move up, they'll assemble AST's public forecasts and street estimates:

https://preview.redd.it/7kr4k034eoo71.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b16d3d1c9247da0ec0c26ac04afbec3c0a1e8c

* As you can see, Deutsche Bank is the most optimistic haircutting AST's 2025E topline by 33% whereas Barclays applies a more severe haircut of 61%.
* The douchebag analyst will probably take the quickest approach by just averaging the two street estimates to create **""Street Consensus""**, which is easy to explain to their PM
   * Note that AST and the analysts expect steady state EBITDA margins to be north of 96% as the company will be relying on telco partners for subscriber acquisition and maintenance costs

&#x200B;

**Comparable Valuation Analysis:**

* Next the douchebag analyst will pull together a comparable valuation analysis ""comps"". They'll likely select the following companies:
   * **$IRDM:** vertically integrated, niche global connectivity provider of voice and low-throughput data services (176kbps - 704kps) to bulky proprietary satellite phones. Offers 100 minutes of voice and 100 text messages for $89.99 a month and has 1.6 Million subscribers globally.
   * **$GSAT:** they'll throw this vertically integrated old school satellite phone provider in the analysis, but it's not really comparable. GSAT has some interesting satellite spectrum that could be utilized for limited regional emergency phone connectivity in future handsets. However the company's satellites are old and need to be decommissioned and replaced with new satellites utilizing a similar approach that AST has patented (high powered, large phased array aperture satellites) to provide anything beyond emergency messaging services. GSAT offers various voice plans starting at $79.99 a month for 150 minutes and has 745,000 subscribers.
      * Take a look at both Iridium and Globalstar phones, which require large antennas and high power to connect to their respective satellites for voice and low-speed data services. AST‚Äôs satellites will allow you to use your current handset for voice and broadband internet!

https://preview.redd.it/1hzjc1h9eoo71.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=b780be9b64755f2b19be031183ae7003304faf0a

&#x200B;

* **$AMT $CCI $SBAC:** AMT is an investor and sits on the board of AST. AMT has made it clear that AST's technology could help reduce the need to build out expensive cellular towers in low density areas which could save telco partners significant future capital expenditure $. Once AST's constellation is up and running, the business model would be very similar to wireless tower companies like AMT/CCI/SBAC where they enter into long-term partnership agreements with telcos and provide the infrastructure (towers) that enable connectivity to subscribers.
   * Tower companies enjoy long-term agreements and predictable cashflows, which have enabled many to convert to REITs as they pass along a steady stream of income to shareholders. Similarly, once AST has invested in deploying its constellation, aside from some minimal maintenance capex the cashflows will be substantial to the point where the AST will likely institute a dividend and/or return capital to shareholders via share buybacks.
   * Here‚Äôs a video of AMT‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer talking about AST: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc)

https://preview.redd.it/loxfvskgeoo71.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcd29da48bf96a69e8b95400a1e1590ef6aab050

 

**Probability Weighing the Outcome:**

* So the douchebag analyst has put together valuation ""comps"", using haircut public estimates and peer 2025E EBITDA multiples:
   * From this comparison, he can support **$100 - $150 per share for AST if it is successful**
   * Keep in mind that all of these comps exhibit much lower growth rates... if the company can execute the valuation multiple ascribed should be higher
* Now this is where qualitative due diligence is important. The douchebag analyst may talk to Deutsche Bank and Barclays research to get a feel for probabilities of success. They may also talk to the AST and read reddit posts like this one. *What's the probability for success here?*
* Deutsche Bank takes an equal weighted approach of 25% for management case, 25% for DB case, 25% for conservative and 25% for zero. The douchebag analyst may take a similar approach:
   * 33% chance of full success resulting in $100 or $150 price
   * 33% for partial success resulting in a $30 price. Maybe the service works but is slow or subscribers aren‚Äôt as quick to adopt the service ‚Ä¶ so you might end up with something like $IRDM, which is worth $6 billion
   * 33% of total failure resulting in $0. This is pretty punitive given the growing patent portfolio, but zero it is!
* Based on the valuation analysis above, this is what expected values might look like using forward 2025E EBITDA multiple discounted back 2 years by 15 discount rate to get to beginning of CY2022
   * **Using $IRDM as a comparable: $32**
   * **Using Tower Cos as comparables: $45**

https://preview.redd.it/tb69ua6keoo71.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=93269552f8e09dcdcc842e3e2e0c9feb53aef0ec

**Conclusion:**

* Most institutions will likely ignore AST until we get within a few months from the scheduled March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3 satellite aboard SpaceX.
   * Once BlueWalker-3 is successfully deployed, it will allow for full scale testing of AST‚Äôs technology and service ahead of Phase I deployment for equatorial coverage and service
* However, once institutions and retail start to focus on this event the valuation exercise that I outlined above will be kicked off at generalist, event-driven, Tech/Media/Telecom and other douchebag hedge fund desks across the street
* These douches completing their valuation analyses will then lead to FOMO position building in anticipation of BlueWalker-3‚Äôs launch which should cause the stock to ramp (who is going to miss out on what could be the most disruptive company in wireless?!?!)
   * Yes, the effective float here is tiny at 36.9M shares once you remove the 9.2M held by strategics purchased via PIPE. Management and employees are locked up for 1 year
      * Although SPAC sponsor is locked up for 1 year as well, they are allowed to trade 33% of their shares (3.9M) if the stock price exceeds $12 for any 20 of 30 trading days at least 150 days after deal close
* **The stock currently sits at $11 vs. expected values of $32 to $45 at year end, where should it trade now? How about in 3 months?**
* I'm a big believer in the company and the valuation outlined above is very conservative (using street estimates that take significant haircuts to management projections).
* I'm one of a growing base of investors that continues to diligence AST and its opportunity as I underwrite my investment everyday. Even if you're skeptical of AST's probability of success, having a small position sized to zero can mean significant upside if it works!

‚Äã‚Äã4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM‚Äôs Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn‚Äôt pay out high dividends (\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden‚Äôs $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

367,prutcy,1632144225.0,797fed1l,odcomiccollector,One might ask how a bank in China is fucking our vibe. Let's take a fucking look.,"Hello my fellow crayon eating fucks. Today in ""what the fuck"" we will be looking at how a cluster fuck in China is fucking up our vibe.

Understand; banks primarily make money through mortgages. If default risk increases (expected home values tank) then banks are upside down - they will have no money to loan and will not let you withdraw. And before you fucks start in with FDIC fucker. Let me tell you about the speed of fucking government. It's fucking SLOW.

Now that we understand this. Why does our market have to have its vibe fucking wrecked? Globalization. Globalization is sold as an ide of a common collective rising tides lift all ships and that kind of fucking shit.

What globalization really is is a way to increase risk by combing two cluster fucks into one. Hence our vibe is fucked right now. We control very well what happens within the US economy. We can't do Jack shit about what happens in China's, but because globalization let's go ahead a fuck up our vibe by mixing their real-estate with ours!

What globalization really is like is you giving me access to your bank account, I put in a little and say we have derisked and elevated our status. I then spend all the fucking money. You ask hey I thought we were in this together! I say yea, my rent is $20k a month and yours is $200. I have a loan for $1M that needs payments and you don't. So, I'm helping you by making sure our collective bills are paid on my side. Now when I default. You and I both have the account claimed by creditors.

That is globalization in a nutshell and that is why our vibe has been fucking nuked today.

Have a good fucking day!",734,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28eb47dc0>

369,pru7w5,1632142262.0,8b4smhez,Gsteenbruggen,The ‚ÄúOctober effect‚Äù and how you can play it correctly,"October has a special place in finance, known as the October effect, and is one of the most feared months in the financial calendar. Let's have a look to see whether there's any merit behind the fear. The events that have given October a bad name span over 100 years.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The October effect refers to the psychological anticipation that financial declines and stock market crashes are more likely to occur during this month than any other month.


The Bank Panic of 1907, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and Black Monday 1987 all happened during the month of October.

Historically speaking, however, September has had more down markets than October.
The psychological effect that causes some traders to blame October for stock market declines may actually make it one of the better buying opportunities for contrarian investors.

Taking the Blame for September

Oddly enough, September, not October, has more historical down markets. More importantly, the catalysts that set off both the 1929 crash and the 1907 panic happened in September or earlier, and the reaction was simply delayed. 

In 1907, the panic nearly occurred in March and, with the tension building over the fate of trust companies, could have happened in almost any month. 

The 1929 crash arguably began when the Fed banned margin-trading loans in February and cranked up interest rates.

I‚Äôm really hoping evergrande makes it out of the hole they‚Äôre in, and doesn‚Äôt start a domino effect. I have been skeptical with the markets recently and wanna make sure everyone‚Äôs extra careful with their investments in the next couple months.

373,pru1vj,1632141685.0,bug5uqwt,Hwangin_it,China Evergrande situation is good for the stock market,"What is the most powerful force in the universe? We should all know by now: Saint Powell‚Äôs printer. Money printer go brrr; stonks go up: pure and simple.

Evergrande will most likely be forced to sell a significant portion of its property in a fire-sale because the Chinese government‚Äôs bailout will likely be modest, to discourage excessive leverage and speculation in the economy. The government wants to contain the economic fallout while sending a clear message that it will not always provide a bailout safety net. As property prices drop and liquidity tightens, China‚Äôs wealth will decline and domestic growth will slow down. Global economic growth, as a whole, will also slow down, given it is heavily reliant on China‚Äôs economy. As a result, the Fed, and most likely central banks globally, will be forced to delay tapering and push rate hikes well into 2023. Thus, the well-oiled machine that is the debt cycle will continue running in overdrive mode.

And if you‚Äôre wondering what stonks to own in a slow growth environment - think GARP or growth at a reasonable price. Investors feel uncomfortable investing in overvalued growth stocks in an uncertain, slow growth environment. At the same time, GARP plays become more desirable because they have more realistic valuations, during an uncertain period. It‚Äôs human nature to want certainty during an uncertain period: overvalued high growth plays will lose favour and money will rotate into GARP and value plays.

I like to think my entire portfolio, $WISH, is a GARP play. Yes, WISH is not even profitable and has a negative EPS, which suggests it is overvalued, but it is extremely undervalued according to other metrics like price-to-sales, especially when compared to its industry peers. I‚Äôm just like you: I‚Äôm merely using every piece of news, relevant or otherwise, to confirm my bias‚Ä¶.

Stonks only go up‚Ä¶.

# The Perfect Storm: 

Contrary to what most of you degenerates thought in my previous post, the evidence further and further shows that Evergrande may not receive a bailout but potentially use them as a **‚Äúexample company‚Äù** while turning their printers on. **Already, China has added 90B Yuan ($14B) liquidity into the banking system.** Although this seems like a small value, adding nearly 100B Yuan of liquidity rarely occurs.

[Will China turn its printer on? Unsustainable.](https://preview.redd.it/einze0umjno71.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce152c6a7699618ecb0c364b2cd6b2624053d92b)

**Based on the latest news and data, I see a perfect storm brewing on a few fundamental factors:**

1. **The China Contagion.** Evergrande is basically real estate COVID and banks are patient zero.  Evergrande isn‚Äôt the only Chinese real estate developer at risk. The top 10 alone are at risk of defaulting, more so due to Evergrande (regardless of a bailout or not). Entire sectors will get destroyed too such as construction, materials, and finance.
2. Tether may be backed by ‚Äúcommercial paper‚Äù aka ‚ÄúChina Money‚Äù and other debt that is backed by Evergrande. This would further fuk China and their heavy hand in this year‚Äôs Buttcoin run up. 
3. Even if Evergrande wanted to, they can‚Äôt sell shit. Consumer and institutional sector confidence is down to all-time lows. A fire sale is largely possible. 
4. Internal panic and 
5. This one‚Äôs a meme, but the same advisors that helped the clearly successful Enron & Lehman Broskis were now hired by Evergrande.

In fact, Evergrande has already begun to repay its investors with ‚Äúphysical assets‚Äù aka property, according to Reuters. Many of these properties are still under construction while others are being destroyed like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/prf8ji/china_demolishes_15_buildings_in_45_seconds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

**Contagion 2021:** 

Currently, the majority of news is focused primarily on Evergrande itself, ignoring the several other real estate developers and banks that are also tied in the loop. Over the past decade, we have seen China grow rapidly, spending any resources necessary to grow, grow, grow. At this point, Xinnie the Pooh has been erect for debt for 10 years. What we know is the high **contagion risk** described by Saxo Bank as:

*‚ÄúA default poses funding problems to Chinese real estate corporates and the Chinese banking sector, which inevitably increased exposure to the real estate giant during the past decade.‚Äù*

Basically, RE companies and the banking sector are fucked. The contagion is far worse when you realize many American banks including Citi, GS, and JPM were ‚Äúattracted like moths‚Äù to China‚Äôs RE sector just this year.

The UBS can also be quoted saying, *""Three weeks ago we did not see any imminent risk of a credit event occurring for Evergrande. Since then, there have been a number of setbacks which have led us to believe that a credit event seems unavoidable"".* 

So, let‚Äôs start off with the top 15 RE companies in China currently:

[Damn this debt is THICC.](https://preview.redd.it/kqfrh3lvjno71.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efc0dd2ea0ea48f956acb48f278c5f6ebbcf985)

The sum of **debt** across these companies is approximately 2.44T Yuan or **$377,532,312,360**. **Note that is not total liabilities, simply debt.** All of the bonds associated with these firms are near default levels due to missed interest payments, and this debt along with other liabilities **amounts to nearly $500B in total liability.** 

# Tether Troubles

I‚Äôm no Butter or Buttcoin fan, so the downfall of Tether stirs something deep inside my balls‚Ä¶ Anyways, there is a clear case presented by [@TheLastBearSta1](https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1435231303633448963?s=20) on Twitter that everyone should check out. I wanted to go more in depth, but it is late, I have classes and I thought it would be better to provide the sources and you can all make your own views. Plus, I‚Äôm not sure what WSB allows regarding Buttcoin.

#  TIMELINE: 

These are the most important dates this year that would accelerate the Evergrande Implosion if it does not occur within the next week: 

1. **Oct 23rd - March 2022 offshore bonds default on this day if Evergrande fails to pay interest.**
2. **Oct 29th - March 2024 offshore bonds default on this day if Evergrande fails to pay interest.** 

All of these are actually due on **Sept 23rd and 29th** but 30 days for late payments are allowed so my guess is that Evergrande will stretch this out as long as possible. These dates and **Nov 10th** are the main ones to watch for a credit event (such as a default).  

However, tonight‚Äôs price action tells me this will all blow up within a week‚Ä¶ 

# Enrongrande: 

""California-based Houlihan Lokey, which set up an office in Hong Kong in 2007 and Beijing in 2010, topped the list of America‚Äôs biggest debt restructuring advisory firms over the past six years. It had roles in the workouts at Enron, WorldCom, and Lehman, among others.‚Äù

I literally have no words...

376,prtrge,1632140643.0,89a87wr2,Order_Flimsy,Could Bumble Help You Retire A Millionaire?,"Bumble (BMBL) has been a volatile investment since its IPO. The female-oriented dating app maker went public at $43 per share in February, and its stock opened at $76 before hitting $84.60 less than a week after its debut.

Bumble's stock tumbled back below its IPO price in May, but it subsequently rebounded to the high $50s after it posted a strong second-quarter report in August. Could Bumble still help you retire a millionaire over the long term? Let's take a fresh look at the bull and bear cases to find out.

What the bulls will say about Bumble
Bumble owns two apps. Its namesake app, which hosts more paying users and generates most of its revenue, only allows women to make the first move. Its older app, Badoo, is more similar to Tinder and generally more popular in Europe and Latin America.

The bulls believe Bumble can carve out a high-growth niche against Match Group (MTCH), which owns Tinder, Hinge, OK Cupid, and other popular dating apps. Bumble's share of the U.S. dating app market rose from 10% in 2017 to 19% in 2020, according to Sensor Tower, putting it firmly in second place behind Tinder's 40% share.

Bumble's number of paid users across both apps rose 20% year-over-year to 2.9 million last quarter. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 13% at Bumble and 4% at Badoo. Bumble expects its total revenue to rise 29% to 31% this year, while analysts expect Match's revenue to grow 26%.

Those growth rates indicate there's plenty of room for Bumble's female-friendly platform to grow. Over the long term, Bumble plans to expand into new overseas markets like India, as well as monetize its BFF feature for platonic friendships and Bizz feature for business connections.

Bumble ended last quarter with $252 million in cash and equivalents and $642 million in total debt. That gives it a fairly low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

Bumble could also benefit from a recent court ruling against Apple that will allow companies to integrate their own in-app payment systems to bypass Apple's 15% to 30% cut of App Store fees.

The global online dating market could grow at a CAGR of 8.44% between 2021 and 2025, according to Statista Research. If Bumble merely matches the market's growth rate, it could generate $1.05 billion in annual revenue in 2025.

But Bumble is growing faster than Match and the broader market, and that trend could continue as it gains more users, launches new premium tiers, expands its international business (which generated 43% of its revenue in the first half of 2021), and monetizes BFF and Bizz as non-dating social networks. Bumble could also acquire smaller dating apps to diversify its portfolio and widen its moat against Match.

Bumble's market cap of $10.7 billion is less than a fourth of Match's market cap of $45.5 billion. Bumble trades at 14 times this year's sales, while Match has a comparable price-to-sales ratio of 15. Therefore, Bumble's higher growth rates and lower valuations could give it more room to run than Match.",0,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x290d36910>
377,prtgc2,1632139473.0,7apv5d45,Technical-Ad-3967,Why Crash? But Stonks Only Go Up?,"1. The 2017 tax bill put more money into the hands of the ultra wealthy and corporations.  What do they do when they get more money?  They do stock buybacks to artificially inflate the value of stonks.  Gladly, some of the small guys got some nice tax refunds as well, but don't be fooled.  You weren't the main beneficiary.  The effects of a large tax bill like this take many years to show in the broad economy.
2. The Covid crash gave these individuals an opportunity to deploy this capital into the markets.  This is why you probably missed that beautiful bottom in March of 2020.  Institutions know the importance of buying the real dips.  1-5 percent corrections are nothing.
3. The CARES Act, Trumps second stimulus package (I can't remember the name), and Biden's American Rescue Plan threw money into corporations as well!  Gladly, this time, the average consumer also got to get in on the fun.  Crazy unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, loan forbearance and so on.
4. Fed tapering is coming (I'll add more later)
5. The Chinese housing crisis is unfolding (I'll add more later)

This bull run can't continue forever.  We're about to experience the largest boom bust cycle ever.  No, I can't give you a timeline... But, I can tell you that I just sold my 2019 Honda Civic SI for a profit.  That is a phrase no man should ever be able to say.  One month later, used cars finally started a down trend.

I'll add supportive data later, but I have to go to work!  No matter what you believe, best of luck!  Invest wisely. :D",201,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x290d801f0>

This is RKLB since its merger date. This is different to the vast majority of SPACs in a few ways.

1. No mass sell off after the merger, this is common with SPACs, look at SPCE, it dropped 27.5% in the few days after in merged. RKLB has not dropped at all, this means institutional investors that were in from the beginning all believe RKLB is well undervalued at $10, and are holding for something higher.
2. Solid support at the 15$ mark. Things got a bit frothy at $20, this is understandable, at the point RKLB hit $20, there was virtually no coverage on the major outlets. Even now, at 15$, according to Finviz, only two have started coverage (both BUYS at $18 price targets). As more outlets begin coverage and call RKLB a BUY, that support at $15 will solidify and we'll head back towards $20+ territory.

RKLB DD for the uninitiated:

Rocketlab is a full service Space launch provider. They have a successful rocket named Electron which is black and honestly the sexiest rocket out there. The are very well diversified and their most recent results a few weeks ago showed a 6x increase in the portion of their revenue derived from Space Systems (things like their own Satellite, Photon, and their reaction wheel and other satellite components manufacturing)

This is essential to their success, while they're well ahead of any competitor (except Space X) in their launch abilities, their diversification will help them beat the upcoming competition in the long run. In a few years there will be other successful small sat launchers (ASTR, Firefly, Virgin Orbit etc.), but without the diversification RKLB has, the will eventually fade into obscurity.

They have over **100 successful satellites launched** with their 3D printed Electron rockets and will be launching from the US this year.

Currently **developing their Neutron Rocket which will be very similar to the Falcon 9**, given their track record I fully believe they‚Äôll have this is in operation by their target year of 2024. Of course, Space X is ahead of them in this regard, but there is room for competition in this sector.

Developing **on-orbit refuelling**, this is something Space X are also developing with Starship, Rocketlab want to do this with their Photon satellites, which are currently operational, so it‚Äôs very possible they could do this before Space X.

Their **CEO literally ate his hat** in a promo video. He‚Äôs New Zealand Elon Musk, what else is there to say?

Earlier this month, a black swan flew into the plaza of Tiananmen Square, stirring speculation on what this would symbolically mean. China has already had a rough last couple of months; dealing with floods, typhoons, hailstorms, sandstorms, landslides, and a pandemic to boot. Surely this swan is of no significance right?

[Honk Honk, motherfucker. ](https://preview.redd.it/kyfhdq7nyko71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb963e892a0b61f496c0c83e31dc4a4a08b11bf)

# The Problem

Enter the Chinese housing bubble. Unlike Americans which diversify into stocks, bonds, real estates etc, China largely invest in real estate. Furthermore, 40-60% of the price of real estate in mainland china is the cost of the land and taxes collected by local governments. This has led to a rapid unsustainable rise in the price of housing in some parts of China.

https://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab

And what does all that get you? Some shit-ass [tofu-dreg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project) construction housing, that makes Haitian building codes look good. Built using concrete that's more reminiscent of dirt, rebar that's more reminiscent of twigs, these buildings were built by developers to turn a profit as quickly as possible, and bought by individuals who seek to sell them at a higher price to the next sucker. This process can perpetuate itself until a catalyst presents itself.

# The catalyst: Evergrande

Enter the catalyst to China's housing bubble, Evergrande: China's second largest real estate developer. On September 8th, Evergrande Wealth, which offers wealth management products to clients in China, failed to deliver interest payment to its clients. As a result, victims and clients have staged large scale protests at Evergrande HQ for several days in a row.

https://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54

On August 31, Evergrande confessed that work on 1.5 million properties have been halted due to delays in payment to its creditors, suppliers, and contractors. After absorbing $7.5B USD in wealth product deposits, Evergrande Wealth purchased $12.4B of junk assets that Evergrande could not sell.

# The Problem

Evergrande was due a loan payment today (September 20), but told banks it was unable to pay it. Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on **September 23** for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million in interest due on **September 29** for its March 2024 notes. Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it's properties as payment, triggering a fire sale. This is similar to the firesale of mortgage backed securities back in 2008 (Lehman brothers / bear stearns flashbacks). It also don't help that China has become over 250% leveraged in debt.

# The Contagion

China Evergrande Group employs over 200,000 full time employees across multiple sectors including real estate, renewable energy vehicles, tourism, sports, finance, and health; and indirectly provides over 38 million jobs across China. Over 1.5m customers / clients have a vested interest in Evergrande. If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. Millions would be underwater on their mortgage loans (which mind you, is really fucking expensive given the outrageous pricing of the homes) From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.

* Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.
* Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.
* Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country
* Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.
* Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.
* China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020. Companies in these countries that are dependent on Chinese trade may take a hit.
* Millions of Chinese citizens stricken with debt and underwater properties: Expect a reduction in consumer buying power if this happens.
* Chinese Government: In 2020, land transfer fees accounted for 46% of national revenue, and 84% of local government revenue. Some cities rely 100% on land revenue for income.

# The Cataclysm

If China's real estate bubble bursts, it can take out China's financials and Real Estate companies in a domino effect. S&P Global reported that over $50b in Real Estate bonds are due in 2021, and the rate of companies defaulting on bonds is rising. This contagion can easily spread to world financial sectors that are overexposed in Chinese real estate Junk Bonds.

# Salt the Wound

To make matters worse, recent events in China is throwing in bonus catalysts into the mix, potentially magnifying the fallout of a total collapse.

* Business and Stock Market crackdown / interference: The CCP has prevented companies from listing on US stock exchanges (thus preventing its companies from acquiring new liquidity), applied regulatory pressures to the gaming, communications, education, and media sectors. Furthermore, the CCP has applied a narrative that is pro-chinese, anti-foreigner, [creating hostile environments for foreign businesses to work with China.](https://www.lovemoney.com/gallerylist/98705/big-multinational-companies-moving-out-of-china)
* Zero Covid Policy: The CCP is taking extreme measures to prevent a delta covid outbreak or another mutation. This has led to governments taking steps to place its citizens in mandatory quarantine and shut down select business sectors.
* Lying Flat: Millennial in China are silently protesting working conditions and the rat race by laying flat.
* Huarong Distressed Bank Bailout: In 2018, Lai Xiaomin was executed for embezzling and fucking over their state owned distressed debt management company, Huarong.
* Aging population and a social security crisis for the elderly: Companies in China prefer to hire younger people. Unfortunately due to China's previous regulations on population control (1 child policy), it has created a situation where there aren't a lot of millenials, but tons of retiring boomers. Imagine the US social security deficit x10.

# Ok stfu so how do I make some fuckkkinn $$$$$???

Based on my DD, I am taking up bear positions on:

* ASHR: Shenzhen / Shanghai A-Share ETF - Direct exposure to Chinese Stocks
* EWH: Hong Kong Index ETF - A lot of Chinese companies list here due to better liquidity
* MCHI: China broad ETF - A catch all ETF for Chinese exposure
* WYNN / LVS: An overleveraged 116% debt-to-equity US headquartered Casino where over 50% of its revenues come from Macau China in midst of a gambling crackdown and potential recessionary implosion (This is affected by consumer discretionary sector swings). LVS is another alternative stock similar to WYNN.

# Counter-Case

u/Ropirito's dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/):

1. Bailing  them out would encourage other retards in the sector to follow the same  path of reckless borrowing (this has happened twice before on a smaller  scale). However, it may prevent damage to millions of Chinese  homeowners that would stir discontent and weaken the CCP.
2. The  problem is simply too huge. In the name of development and GDP, Xi gave  Evergrande a free pass and $300B worth of Yuan would need to be printed  to cover them. Not only would this devalue the Yuan but it makes up **2.1%** of China‚Äôs GDP. This is simply a case where the concept of ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù may not actually be valid.
3. Even  if a bailout did occur, that‚Äôs not a good look. Consumer confidence  would decrease rapidly and other firms would continue to push new market  bubbles under the assumption that a bailout will always be available.  Volatility in prices would increase rapidly as there would be confusion  between how the PRC prices property versus individual developers. This  would reflect uncertainty in the general stock market as well as a  bailout indicating weakness in stocks and the overall economy‚Äôs  stability.
4. [Fuck you, China bulls - China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-evergrande-should-not-bet-govt-bailout-global-times-editor-2021-09-17/)
5. Even if China bails out its companies and citizens underwater and stricken with debt, that does not mean your shitty VIE ADRs ""representing one share"" of a cayman island shell company will get the same treatment. Daily reminder that Chinese investments are always inherently risky. They are the only stocks that don't comply with PCAOB audits, so financial valuations can be hot garbage for all they care. Financials presented to foreigners are also separate from what they keep at home, SEC has a 2024 deadline to comply with PCAOB or get delisted. If you think that China bailing out its people will save your precious VIE ADR as a foreigner then LMAO

# Other Thoughts

^(I am not an economist, this is not an economic forecast)

* The US market should survive this. The United States is not dependent on the Yuan, and we have sufficient controls in place to keep banks in check (Sarbanes Oxley). Any excessive overreaction, especially in the semiconductor industry, should recover fairly quick as demand still outpace supply.
* Bonds, even high yield bonds (e.g. HYG, JNK) may present itself at a discount later and bounce no problem. Search ETF holdings for chinashit and most are devoid of them (some may have MGM Macau in there which isn't much). General risk of contagion in the financial sector within the US should be isolated to accredited investors and high risk fund managers. Your wife and your wife's boyfriend's retirement accounts are safe.
   * (UNLESS) fund managers are making bullshit assets like MBS within MBS bundled up and hiding them in plain sight and stuffing them in high AUM etfs. If this happens again, good luck folks.
* We will likely see some recovery this week as JPOW turns on his printer while China burns. China may rally as well on Tuesday. I believe we are in the denial stage.

385,pro6ya,1632114662.0,58lkkbu7,StarSwitch,Options Hedging for 20 SEP 21: SDC IRNT GME SPY+,"**TLDR: Stop gambling you allowance money without doing some due diligence. Read and you might learn something.** 

**Some intro:** I model how market making options moves underlying stocks. This has led to some cool predictions like a certain GameStore on a certain week in January doing some unusual things. Seriously go check my stuff out. Options move the underlying in a very quantifiable manner. Additionally examining the OI gives insights into market sentiment and price expectations. 

**Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started.**

Options are extremely volatile. That's why we're all here but Market Makers follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason. Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid/Ask (literally making the market). MM's usually have both ends of a trade, i.e short both calls and puts, which balances out but the net difference results in a directional position. This has to be hedged for multiple reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt and 2.  betting against clients (this is serious.) They make their money from scalping the B/A and IV crush. Options are priced that if Œî neutral, the MM makes money when IV decreases and loses if it increases. 

That brings us to Delta (Œî). **Œî is the rate of change with respect to spot price (+/- $1)**. Now that doesn't mean anything but think about Œî as the % chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. Gamma Œì is the rate of change of Œî for +/- $1 on the underlying. Œì is also hedged on MM books. This is done by trading shares and contracts of the underlying which influences price discovery resistance levels. 

To model this we make a few assumptions:

* All contracts are being hedged directionally neutral (This isn't true but is an acceptable assumption to yield a working model)
* The directional risk of a call and put on the same strike counteract
* Enough of the boring stuff

This will be less in depth and more broad in scope than my previous work. More of an overview for the week. A few of these tickers (the SPACS) were requests and not my own positions. Also ignore the ""Hybrid Factor %"". I'm trying something new to  measure signal. Higher should be better but idk if if works yet.

389,prnoeo,1632112398.0,oco7h7q,nafizzaki,Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies],"Hello! I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.

*if you are already an experienced trader, ignore this post.*

Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:

* Everything is not a short squeeze. Seriously. I have seen people claiming stocks like PLTR, SPY etc is short squeeze. It is not. There are very specific criteria that makes things a short squeeze, and without understanding that, you might lose money thinking that everything is a short squeeze.   


1. Most of the time, when some redditor is claiming a short squeeze, it's probably just that that person wants everyone to pile into that stock so that their options/stocks gain value and could make a quick exit. So, the intention is to create a pump and dump scheme. You may make money if you are early, but most likely you are not early at all.

[Short squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell?

Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative.

We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.

&#x200B;

* Everything is not a gamma squeeze. I saw a post today about Gamma squeeze, and that's what made me write this post.

[Here's the link to that wsb post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/)

[What is Gamma?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) I think if you follow this investopedia article and read through the various links linked there, you will under pretty easily.

&#x200B;

* Understand the basics of options, seriously, you don't even know what an options chain is (that happene), yet you are throwing money at some random redditors words, that's just bad for your financial health. Seriously. **You shouldn't touch options until you realise what you are doing. If you lose money after you realise what you are doing, well, that's all right.**

You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.

&#x200B;

* Puts are not bad and is not equivalent to burning money. Puts and swaps are instruments that could be really useful in a trading plan. Understand this. If buying puts is really equivalent to burning money, then why do all these huge investors do it? Because they are retarded? Not really.   
Why are puts generally more expensive than calls?

They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%üòÇ or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  üíº holder.

&#x200B;

* Special dividend doesn't make a stock suddenly worth it to buy. I have seen some dumb plays being shared in wsb that company Something (I forgot the company ticker) is going to announce special dividend, so let's just buy the stock. Unless you can create such a hype that autists pile onto the stock for no reason, then special dividend suddenly doesn't really change things.

The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.

&#x200B;

* Bonds are not lame. It is an instrument that may not have its applicability in this sub, but to imply that anyone who buys bonds is burning money or to create false rumours to that extent is really misleading and I have seen lots of redditors imply this.

Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that? [Sauce](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html)

Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.

&#x200B;

* Understand the taxes that you might have to pay, before you gamble and use tax sheltering facilities that the government is providing you. I don't know if you are an US retard or not, but to my knowledge, most countries have some form of tax advantages or som schemes similar to that, use that to gamble your money.

Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have.

This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this [will help start in your journey.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxshelter.asp)

Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.

&#x200B;

* Be sceptical. This is the best thing to understand. Even if you ignore all of my other points, don't ignore this, just be more sceptical. No one lost money by not entering a play. Someone is showing rocket emojis, dildos, some gibberish, drawing, meme etc to induce you to buy something, be sceptical. Why is that person pumping AAPL (although very few may have lost money in that), what is his motive? Why is he writing such a long essay on that particular stock? Ask questions. 

You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.

&#x200B;

* Don't trust the comments, do your own DD. Seriously. You might see a lot of coordinated efforts if you really dig into some of the profiles.

&#x200B;

* Technical analysis is not astrology for men. While I don't use technical analysis much, technical analysis in its core, just shows you where the buyers and sellers are. And it can be helpful to enter and exit a trade.

Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format.

Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades.

Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.

&#x200B;

* CPI is not a sham. I have seen people claim general inflation has been 10% or whatever imaginary number for the last 2 decade and things like that. And I am unable to neither laugh nor react to it.

To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI.

Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable. [Here you will find CPI weights of each sector.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) The question if CPI includes hous or not is answered by this [paper](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/08/art1full.pdf) succinctly.

You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading [material.](https://www.thestreet.com/economonitor/emerging-markets/deconstructing-shadowstats-why-is-it-so-loved-by-its-followers-but-scorned-by-economists)

Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.

&#x200B;

*  I have seen many more rumours or other bogus claims but I feel like I should get some sleep, so I am stopping here. Other kind redditor may continue from here in the comments section. To give you some hints about some other false rumours, they are mostly about Chinese tech giants like Alibaba; about [quantitative easing and inflation  misconceptions](https://www.lynalden.com/inflation/) or even misconceptions about cry pto etc.

Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!",152,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x291d19820>

395,prknbb,1632100407.0,btct43pm,InvincibleIbex,"Why $IRNT, $OPAD, and $TMC didn't infinity squeeze 9/17","Recently, I got fucked on the latest meme run, so I thought I'd try to figure out where I (and the other bonobos) went wrong.  Not saying this is right because my IQ is in the double digits and divisible by 38, but here goes.  If this is wrong, please offer insight as I do want to understand my mistakes.

Anyway, here are some quick thoughts on $IRNT, $OPAD, and $TMC.  If you're like me, you might have thought they would moon on 9/17, as MMs would be forced to buy millions and millions of shares.  After actually learning something about options, I came to realize why this wasn't the case.  The part of the DDs that mentioned the low floats due to redemptions and lockups were solid, but the notion that MMs would suddenly have to buy millions of shares was in a lot of cases just wrong.  As an example, let's say IRNT was trading at $25 on 9/15 and the open interest for the 15C 9/17 options was 15k.   People might quickly cite this as a reason the stock will moon.  MMs have to buy 1,500,000 shares in a day and if we hold all the shares, they are screwed.  This ignores the crux of delta hedging.  When an option is at the money, it has a delta of \~0.5.  This means that if you sold an ATM call, you'd need roughly 50 shares in order to be **delta neutral**.  Delta neutral simply means that you are not making or losing money.  The problem is that delta isn't fixed.  If that option had a **gamma** of 0.1, for example, then as the shares gained a dollar, the option writer would be forced to buy another 10 shares, as the delta would now be at \~0.6.  This is in contrast to simply not buying anything, then being forced to buy shares 9/17.

The problem is, people seemed to not be realizing that the shares needed to hedge the calls sold were already held.  If you bought an ATM option on 9/14 for IRNT at market open, that call quickly became in the money.  As such, MMs quickly bought up shares to remain delta neutral.  If the call you bought had a $20 strike, once the stock started to moon to $30 or even higher, the delta becomes so close to 1 that MMs probably already owned the full 100 shares to cover that call.  So when the apes (myself included) started clamoring and flinging their shit about how the ""MMs have to buy millions of shares"" they were largely wrong.  The shares for those underlying calls were already owned.  The only part that confuses me is what would happen if IRNT closed above $45.  As I understand it, that would have put the total open interest larger than the actual float.  I'm assuming the only way that could happen is if people were using spreads?

short copper--or really any base metal (except iron ore, which has already lost half its value in the past 2 months). 

LAZY ANALYSIS - THE CHINA PART 

seems like a perfect storm is brewing. evergrande is about to crater chinese property development (biggest end use of copper in china, which itself is the biggest source of global copper demand). they're already offering discounted properties in lieu of actual money to their suppliers. that's basically the same kind of fire sale --> falling property prices --> moar fire sale type of thing that the US saw in 2007. so look for chinese property prices to fall off a cliff (already fell 20% last month), and property development and its commodity demand to nosedive ... or maybe just for market retards to panic about that possibly happening.

the CCP can prevent a financial crisis, but they don't look keen to save the property industry itself. they introduced a bunch of laws last year, collectively called the 'three red lines' which basically said 'we wanna bring property developers to heel and slow down housing prices'. 

additionally, the CCP's been selling base metals and other commodities out of their strategic reserves to try to try to jack hammer prices down. so they'd be real cool if a property collapse tanked copper, aluminum, etc. as evidence that they're serious about this sort of thing, a couple months ago the CCP introduced various quotas and regulation to limit steel production, allegedly for environmental reasons, but really because they wanted to crush the price of its main input: iron ore. china imports a shit load of iron ore from australia, who they are in an extended geopolitical spat with. so the CCP wanted to punish australia by hammering the price of its main export. result: iron ore has lost half it's value since july. 

OTHER STUFF 

looks like the Fed is about to taper QE. the recent shock to energy prices (via russia/europe) will probably push them over the edge to doing this. world credit growth has already been contracting--a fed taper will make this worse. that's bad news for bulk commodities: the 'credit impulse' (how much retarded debt is being created to finance retarded construction) is the primary driver of commodity cycles. 

worse, markets are real long commodities right now. CFTC data, while it's come down a little bit lately, shows that leveraged players are spec'ing hard on base metals and other industrial commodities. they've all been caught up in this narrative that this post-covid catch up growth is actually a signal that we're entering some secular commodities 'super cycle'. imo what's really been happening is that commodity production just shut down during the pandemic, causing inventories to get run down, spiking prices. actual consumption of these commodities hasn't moved that much above pre-pandemic levels and inventories have mostly been rebuilt. so a one-off thing got mistaken for a trend and a big demand shock could be about to come out of china, causing leverage speculators to cover their positions --> big overshoot to the downside.

RISKS

eventually the CCP will panic when GDP slows down and they'll force developers to start building ghost towns gain--which means a rebound in demand for copper, etc. fed might back of the taper at some point, too. 

but i think there's a window for a big dip in commodity prices before things get put right.",6,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x291fc4400>

My first red flag would be if we broke 12.5, the second is if we go below 11.70 roughly and then ill pull the plug. we didnt close above the pivot on the weekly which isnt the end of the world though it would've made my dick hard if we did, i believe the candle stick pattern were seeing is bullish on the weekly and indicative of a continuation. im not here shilling the moon or $50 PT in the next 20minutes with a $69 PT by monday and $420 PT on tuesday whopped out from thin air, just a chart, easy and simple.

&#x200B;

Now if i see a rocket launching of 30% or more, ill be selling regardless of price. im taking profit and not leaving much room for regret unless some news comes out, this especially applies towards the open when we might see some shorts and option sellers cover. i could give zero fucks about the fundamentals, options chain, and squeezes. this is a trade based off charts and patterns not magic crystal balls. it can fail or it can succeed. i got a great entry which i mentioned in my first technical analysis post during the AH, my risk is pretty low and reward is pretty high.

My rebound post was intended for people who were holding and scared due to the early day dump and quite frankly the price did bounce and a contribution supporting all the DD i saw cuz i wouldn't have noticed this stock/chart otherwise. granted there are a bunch of bag holders so they should just consider themselves lucky that the chart was painted very nicely. This is not financial advice, I have 4 mental illnesses (that i know of) and just tryna boost my self esteem by successfully earning money while gaining some good karma (not reddit karma lol, actual karma) cuz i need a whole lot of it for my medical school app.

i won't be able to stick around like I did on Friday where i was updating the post and replying to comments constantly all day as much as i enjoyed the sense of community because I have 2 exams this week and classes to attend to along with some personal issues, this is primarily why im posting this on sunday evening instead of monday morning.

either way, good luck everyone, i hope we all make tendies, dont get greedy and no this is not financial advice, just my positions, train of thought and opinions. id eat crayons if I could afford em (crayola only, non of that cheap shit)

&#x200B;

edit1: just saw this bloody chart in between classes, seems like all market shitting. sold 25% of positions and bought 12.5c for $85 a pop hoping for a quick day trade. i wouldn't advise follow suit since ill be in and out fast  or at least i wouldn't have time to come back here and update. quite the shame but as long as we get an intraday bounce ill be green overall which is all i care abt

&#x200B;

edit2: my inner retard is awakening, now 45% in the calls at an average of 88 per contract, i dont advise anyone follow suit as im not a financial advisor, im simply recording my journey

&#x200B;

edi3: sold everything and closed the day 4% profitable, cant stare too much cuz in class and i spotted a volume climax. not taking the risk when in options and not enough day trades to renter and shit",271,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2923bb640>

406,prh48p,1632087517.0,a1nlo4ew,ShortChecker,$IRNT- The DD to know going into next week. Technicals Included.,"So, there's a lot of confusion to $IRNT and I want to provide my perspective. I'm not a professional trader or anything like that.

$IRNT rose based on a few important things. The company itself, Super 8-K Redemption, Option Chain activity, CTB%, and Short Interest, as well as the traction it attracted.

**The company**: They're a Cyber Security Solutions enterprise. Their investment partners are Kleiner Perkins, CS Capital, and ForgePoint Capital. ([here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/about)) Their partners are Microsoft, AWS, CROWDSTRIKE, DomainTools, NUTANIX, Cortex XSoar, Paloalto, IBM Radar, Splunk, Splunk Soar, and SWIMLANE. ([Here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/partners/technology-partners)).

**Quick Summary for this quarter**:

* Solutions provider for cyber attacks, IronNet Cybersecurity (NYSE:IRNT)FQ2 revenue jumped 23% to $6.1M, subscription revenue grew to $5.8M vs. $5.3M last year.
* Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR): $24.1M vs. $19.5M prior.
* Customer Count: 51 compared to 22 last year.
* Operating loss of $17M compared to $14.2M.
* Net loss: $17.2M compared to $14.3M.
* Cash and cash equivalents: $14.1M.
* **Outlook**: ‚ÄúOur cloud-based subscription revenue -- which grew to 60% of product revenue in the first half of the year, a 65% year-over-year growth rate -- is a strong proof point for the business and underscores the fully recurring aspect of our financial model. Our cloud focus coupled with the large deal formation that we are seeing reflects IronNet‚Äôs ease of deployment and increasing market recognition, which keeps us on pace to double ARR in the third quarter and meet our growth objectives for the full year.‚Äù¬†said¬†James Gerber, CFO.
* **FY Guidance**:¬†Revenue of $43M-45M;¬†ARR of $75M as of end of the fiscal year.
* The stock has a market cap of $1.64B and has seen a jump in price of \~19% over the last five trading days.
* Recent bullish rating on the stock by contributor who writes, 'IronNet Is Extremely Undervalued At $20'
* Previously (Sept. 14):¬†IronNet misses on revenue
* Shares jump \~14%¬†during pre-market hours.

**The Public Float**:

Regarding the [Super 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-263381/), this has reduced the float to anywhere between 1.3M to 6M. Additional, [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-272930/) before Super 8-K filing for those who like to read these.

It's looking like the float is realistically between 2.7M - 3.5M. Extremely low and the reason why it moves so easily. Looks like on Friday the shorts and MM won that battle. SI% actually increased on Friday and every Call Above $30.00 was OTM and was definitely mostly written by MM's.

Here's the **Option Chain** for October 15th:

[Option Activity for Oct. 15th](https://preview.redd.it/7vo75izu3jo71.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcdbf55d6840ea2e839d1a5412046c0e83fa15f)

**Short Interest & CTB%**:

Short Interest was at 58% of the float before Friday, and the shorts have actually increased on Friday. Also, I can't access Ortex but I saw a video today of someone looking it up and saw the increase. Anyone with access to confirm on Monday would be great. Don't forget to use the shares amount shorted and divide by the current float.

The CTB% is above 500% this is from iborrowdesk. I know some will debate data etc, but even if you cut that in half thats still outrageous.

[IBorrowDesk](https://preview.redd.it/nl2z9cjx3jo71.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c482c55c65282bd5a7d19c17e4b481c2a535e5e8)

When the weeks start and more data is published this will need to be monitored.

**Technicals**:

First off, the Fibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min):

[Fibonacci Retracement \(5 Day, 5 Min\)](https://preview.redd.it/lohhsia40ko71.jpg?width=1834&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f530524a5595f76e317f2269c4389aa437a7d6d)

You can also see my entry position with the green arrow. If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06.

Started the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39. If we can maintain support above $27.11 and support strong resistance that'll be positive, if we break $27.11, the next resistance line is $19.24. This is were things can get weary as this can be a sign of a negative trend. Good thing is this company seems rock solid, and is being evaluated at <$20.00. But keep this in mind.

Looking to see if a Cup and Handle will form:

[Cup and Handle Example](https://preview.redd.it/gbv44fw24jo71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=823caf5853fd090c12099c1893b43b063a39ff2c)

This is also a stock that is trending heavily, so, technicals can't be completely relied on. Only next week will determine that.

**Google Trends**:

&#x200B;

[7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/ad2upoca4jo71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfa2a677644ee0e7d378f8a4af5bcc01aad9cb79)

&#x200B;

[30 Day Trend](https://preview.redd.it/dcjxb0cc4jo71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00ba95bfb1c9aa6e79a0eb1c3c33bea0a41a9d0)

With this stock closing at $30, if we test support we can very much expect bullish sentiments. If over the next few days support isn't being tested, then supports become resistance.

This stock is highly shorted, has a very large ITM Option Activity, very small float, and a high CTB%.

I think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not. Thing about this stock though is retail owns and can own the float until any PIPE lock ups expire.

That's something else that will be important to follow are the SEC filings for the lock ups.

Overall, this seems to be a solid company with a lot of growth up ahead.

""Its annual recurring revenue also noted a year-over-year growth in the recent quarter to **$24.1 million**. For the full financial year, IronNet now forecasts $75 million of ARR on up to $45 million in revenue."" As of 3 days ago.

I'm not a professional trader what's so ever, I ordered Wendy's for supper. I have no idea where this could go, it really depends on a variety of factors but it's worth watching going into next week and October.

SDC has had a 9.54% increase in short ratio in a week's span. With approximately 5.67 days to cover, this is considered *extremely difficult* due to the limited timeline and increase in CTB. *This means they are obligated to cover their shares this week.*

&#x200B;

**Bollinger Band Chart**

‚ÄúAfter a period of consolidation, the price often makes a larger move in either direction, ideally on high volume. Expanding volume on a breakout is a sign that traders are voting with their money that the price will continue to move in the breakout direction.‚Äù

As you can see, the Bollinger Bands can provide use for determining volatility movements. The arrows point at narrow action.

[Bollinger Band Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/9o6wfrf6oio71.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a47e52e8a8fec0f349e1a46179b73ed01a837cb)

**In short:**

In typical movements, the bands keep a safe distance.

In volatile movements, the bands can become narrow; moving closer towards the middle band, or SMA.

**If you‚Äôre too retarded to understand, this means that narrow=tendiez.**

The final detail to this chart is the occurrence of ovals. Upright ovals have signaled an uptrend, while downright ovals signal a downtrend.

*Not even after a full 24 hours, we saw 2 oval occurrences that led to an uptrend.*

&#x200B;

**Predictions:**

[Consolidation to a Breakout](https://preview.redd.it/jrp9iahaoio71.jpg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=329ce2ff67ebddc77cc19e4c0727e18e7084186a)

9/17/21 AH Bollinger has become narrow.. **We have yet again, another opportunity to catch hedge funds with their dicks out.**

I have highlighted the narrow occurrences with a white rectangle; I have also indicated the consolidation in price action with purple crayon. The rectangle on the right is capturing a potential uptrend, one that can EXCEED the resistance of $7.41. Since the stock has consolidated at a higher price, it‚Äôs only logical to hypothesize a spike greater than before.

CTB is also steadily increasing which means that they are willingly spending more to cover their position. The fact is, they are losing- and doing whatever is possible to stay afloat.

&#x200B;

**What happened here?**

[They got scared](https://preview.redd.it/6pi21ghfoio71.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=806a9502c1972d99cd7ac372925e195e1c763553)

Our support is $6.36 while our resistance is $7.41. Obviously, a massive sell wall is what prevented us from rallying further. Again, we have another opportunity.

&#x200B;

**Bollinger Bandwidth: Measures distance between Bollinger Bands.**

Low BBW= squeeze indication

High BBW= no squeeze indication.

**September 17:** We saw the **BBW (Yes, Big Beautiful Women)**, drop beneath .05. Then, the price action got hard as fuck.

**How many of you idiots got laid last night? How about this week? Oh, none? Maybe if you actually grew some balls and didn‚Äôt have scared money you‚Äôd actually get some bitches on your dick.**

Now, we are at another point in time where the BBW is beneath .05. It‚Äôs self-explanatory what will happen next. Will you continue to sit with your dick flaccid or will you hop in and get some action?

&#x200B;

 **Align Technology is SDC's competitor. Their EPS is over $700. They share the same manufacturer for fucks sake. SDC is extremely undervalued and will be a long term hold.**

410,pres5t,1632080104.0,d4au8,hristopelov,"Evergrande FUD, What the China property market really looks like, what the CCP does, and why it will be a NON issue in general","From [r/baba](www.reddit.com/r/baba):

There are ~30 *major* China property companies. Guangzhou R&F has the most leverage. Actually, of the China government's 3 ""red lines"", G R&F is the worst off. 

These are the CCP's policies. Evergrande can *still* increase debt by +5%

How did Evergrande get into this position? Due to my former life as a equities PM, I've been investing in China property for 13 years. 

Evergrande diversified into non-core businesses, like healthcare, water, sports, tech. They've had the among the higest debt for *many* years.

Why is it being singled out by the media now?
Because while Guangzhou R&F, Greentown have higher debt, Evergrande's margins and profits are worst.

Also profits have fallen off the cliff  at -$1.2bn losses 1H'21. (vs -3% year-on-year growth estimated for the sector)

What happened in the past to high leverage property companies? They were quietly ""faded out"" to a non-event

1) Anbang - $310 bn assets including Waldorf Astoria (NY). Failed restructuring. China government seized control. $5bn valuation at the firesale, vs #Evergrande $4 bn now

2) HNA - purchased prized property assets in debt fueled growth,including investing in Hilton & as the top investor of Deutsche Bank. $200bn debt it couldn't pay. Chairmain Founder 'fell' and died on holiday

3) Dalian Wanda - China's largest mall developer, bought Atletico Madrid & AMC. $6bn debt due 2020. Tycoon (former richest Asian) lost -$32bn salvaging the company

Moral of the story? Nothing dramatic happens. These companies get ""managed"".

In China, the largest banks are State Owned Enterprises. These issues are gradually resolved with moralsuasion or a phone call from the CCP.

In the West, the government doesn't have these ""one phonecall"" tools. This is what Western media doesn't grasp.

The CCP is extremely smart and will do anything to ensures social and financial stability.

Credit Market impact: As in the past, the CCP will ""manage"" the deleveraging process. Just like the media FUD on Anbang, HNA, Dalian Wanda -- likely no shock waves are going to happen in China's credit markets.

Final comment: I spoke to 2 Bloomberg reporters last week. Their bonu$ was dependent on how much their stories could impact a company's stock price. 

So don't believe everything you read.

411,prdibh,1632076140.0,bwz1ypa9,ChillerID,What happened to Nokia $NOK after January 2021 meme hype?,"Crowds were going wild for $NOK in January and the mania lasted for three days before Robinhood halted the trading. $NOK boss fight was about to start after $GME, $AMC, $BB, had shown the way. In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.

&#x200B;

**Global leader in 5G networks**

To keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc.

&#x200B;

**Share count vs Market cap**

Nokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9/17/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.

As a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.

&#x200B;

**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**

Let's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.

Eventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.

Now that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year.

&#x200B;

**Main competitor still banned by US government**

US has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it‚Äôs now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).

Their mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?

There have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.

&#x200B;

Overall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It‚Äôs too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it‚Äôs more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.

&#x200B;

**Competent management with can do attitude**

Pekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit & loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.

Pekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn‚Äôt work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.

&#x200B;

**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G √≠mplementation**

COVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.

Big problems with VR/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.

Private wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.

Oh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.

&#x200B;

**What analysts are saying?**

Analysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. End of July Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.

&#x200B;

Closing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)

Target price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75

Buy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**

&#x200B;

**Peculiar trading activity this week**

Nokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.

With these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.

Disclaimer. I‚Äôm long-term Nokia owner with solid position of shares (9/17/2021 -> up +10%, YTD +49,13 %). I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk.",213,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x292833df0>
412,prdgci,1632075967.0,b9e5y5x8,Prize_Cancel9331,Ebay undervalued," 

Ebay is a e commerce website that allows people to find just about anything they are looking for on their global marketplace aka [ebay.com](https://ebay.com/) . Their platform helps connect millions of buyers and seller all over the world on a daily biases.

**WSB TLDR- Its basically like amazon,etsy,etc**

So whats up with them?

Well, they are undervalued . They have been beating earnings for the last few quarters and are in a very competitive field that will not go away any time soon.

E commerce showed just how big it was thanks to covid. A lot of companies revamped their e commerce portion such as how walmart target and bunch of retail companies allowing people to have curb side pick up ( they come to the parking lot and a store associate goes and drops off their groceries . Doordash and other food delivery services helping save a lot of businesses by allowing people to buy and get food when restaurants couldn't have people come and sit and eat. Etc.. And the biggest example... fucking amazon , the king itself , has crushed earnings with 3 quarters striking over 100 billion dollars in revenue . This e commerce wave was already coming , but covid helped speed it up .

Furthermore since 2020 .. well earlier but ima start from 2020 they started selling off parts of their business to the other companies that specialize in that certain niche. For instance

"" eBay in November agreed to sell its ticketing unit, StubHub, for $4.05 billion to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd. ""(cnbc) **This is old.**

They also sold ebay korea to this huge korean retail gaint that says this will help improve their e commerce portion , while ebay still holds 20% stake.

**TLDR- Ebay is selling off parts of its company that isnt bringing in enough revenue to A cut costs , B gain cash/ value in the long run because they still hold a stake , C making themselves more competitive by focusing on their main revenue streams.**

SUPER IMPORTANT-

Furthermore, Ebay made it official that they will be dropping Paypal effectively allowing Ebay to manage the transactions themselves which means more money for ebay . They will do this by using Adyen, a payments which already has deals with netflix uber and a few other big tech compaines, thus effectively meaning more money for ebay since they are cutting out the middle man.

Ebay these last 4 quarters has been crushing earnings with beat after beat on revenue and eps with the last quarter bringing in 2.67billion vs the expected 2.63 and an eps of .99 vs .96 .

BIG CATALYST

Guess what, its that time of the year again when ebay will perform amazing the fall holiday season is already here with retail stores already getting the candy and shitty spooky theme . Ebay has always performed amazing every time around this time of the year.

I see right now as the time to buy since it isnt priced in yet... here let me say it like this .

Homedepot, lowes and a bunch of other compaines started gaining a lot of value from may , june, july leading up and into hurricane season . Thus when the hurricane came IT WAS ALREADY PRICED IN. Furthermore , most stocks last week including ebay tested out a support line.

Right now , ebay is trading at around 74 bucks which in undervalued

Here price targets are calculated-

Price target = (Stock price / Foward pe )x Current PE

The current pe is the trailing pe

stock price - it closed last friday at 74.11

Forward pe is 17.3

current is 22.59

the pt is about 96.7 as of now for the end of the year

Now granted other factors do matter this the price target gets changed around such as how supply chains have effected the market, covid, competitors but so far ebay has been managing itself and is slowly growing each and every year.

TLDR- Ebay is undervalued asf , its been crushing earnings each quarter, and is about to run up due to the holiday season coming

413,prcdnr,1632072559.0,58uw12u,ChemaKyle,"Why you suck ass at GAMMA squeezing, and what you can do to fix it - TMC, OPAD, IRNT","  

**I. Intro**

Hello degenerates! Not financial advice, I am a retarded degenerate too. 

*TMC, OPAD, and IRNT were supposed to go to the fucking moon, right? Why the hell didn‚Äôt they? Because you have an obsession with OTM call options.* 

First off, answer this question for me: Which call option strikes have the highest gamma? Go ahead, I‚Äôm sure you YOLOing mother fuckers know that before you drop your 100k on **GAMMA** SQUEEZE, right?

Here‚Äôs some pictures I drew on to help you. These are the option chains for each of last week‚Äôs favorites. I‚Äôll highlight the call strike that has the highest gamma. 

**TLDR in section III.**

&#x200B;

[  The Iron Giant ‚Äì You degenerates saw $100 a share everywhere and really went for it. Look at all that open interest at $40. Those MFers were expensive. Look at that, by the end of Friday they only had a delta of 3.1, so about 3 shares hedged for each of those calls. Ouch. ](https://preview.redd.it/fj133ltavho71.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3ae7fd171c61e4100e0aeb113bf72c50daac486)

&#x200B;

[ What strikes? First one in the money, first one out of the money. OPA! ](https://preview.redd.it/45jh9ltavho71.jpg?width=1157&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28c0ffc619e959f76906068314dc368ee61b46d8)

&#x200B;

[  TMC ‚Äì You were supposed to be the chosen one! 160&#37; short interest, massive gamma, low share price.](https://preview.redd.it/ijhuhjtavho71.jpg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ebdc63c195aa7749527ef0728e50a24858c654d)

&#x200B;

But wait a second, doesn‚Äôt gamma move with the stock? Absolutely. And now we learn HOW to gamma.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**II. Buying ATM options is to Gamma Squeezes as Buying and Holding Shares is to Short Squeezes**

So now you know, the highest gamma is the first strike in the money, and first strike out of the money. What does this mean, and why is this the highest gamma position?

A gamma squeeze is essentially taking advantage of market maker delta hedging. The ‚Äúidea‚Äù here is that there is a rush to own shares in large lots as the price moves. The whole purpose of buying a call option is to lock in a price to own 100 shares. It‚Äôs an insurance package. If you are buying at the money options, your breakeven price is pretty close to, but just a bit higher than the share price, depending on volatility (vega gang). 

The *implied* sentiment behind buying at the money options is that you are expecting a continued rise in share price. If you were to go further in the money, you are expecting the share price to remain the same (break even = share price). If you go out of the money, you‚Äôre expecting a miracle and want to donate money to the market maker‚Äôs party fund. 

So what this means for a gamma squeeze, is that in order for it continue, option buying must reflect an *implied sentiment of continued rise in share price*. 

&#x200B;

**III.** **If I want to squeeze the gamma, how do I get the juice? READ THIS IT‚ÄôS YOUR TL;DR**

**SMALL LOTS at a time,**  **BUY FIRST STRIKE IN THE MONEY ‚Äì SELL OFF 90% WHEN 5+ strikes ITM and buy more ATM**

Buy the first strike in the money, every time. It doesn‚Äôt matter the share price. If you are expecting a gamma squeeze, always buy the first strike in the money, or if you‚Äôre really a damn cheapskate, get the first one out of the money.

When the share price rises and puts your call a strike or two in the money, buy another small lot at the money again. Continue to do this.   
 Now once the share price puts your calls 5+ strikes in the money, sell dem bitches and get more AT THE MONEY. The gamma on the calls deep in the money has played out. 

In the money calls have a maximum delta of 100. If you can sell an in the money call, and buy two at the money calls with a delta of 60, now you are effecting a combined delta of 120 on the stock. Your power is growing and the market makers must now hedge even more delta. 

Let‚Äôs look at IRNT for next week. Do you know what you nitwits have done? You‚Äôve opened up massive open interest far out of the money and there‚Äôs almost ZERO in the money calls open. You want a gamma squeeze you‚Äôre gonna have to get sell off those OTM options and buy at the money. I promise you, the share price will not reach your $70 strike option without significant buy volume. The market makers are bringing the majority of the volume as they delta hedge, and they‚Äôre not going to hedge all those calls that are $40 out of the money. There‚Äôs zero reason to. In fact, as we approach expiration, their delta gets LOWER and shares are SOLD by market makers. Don‚Äôt shoot yourself in the foot!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Okay, you've already shot yourselves in the foot, but maybe it can be fixed?](https://preview.redd.it/pvho43sqvho71.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90a98487e6213179783b1f1c1cd7e61c5c762792)

  

Alright, so repeat after me, for a GAMMA squeeze, you buy options with the HIGHEST GAMMA. Which ones are they? First strike in the money, first strike out of the money. 

&#x200B;

I knew the cost to borrow was between between 500-800%, depending on source, but it wasn't until I did some basic math until I realized just how much it costs shorts to, well, stay short.

**Someone that is short 3,500 shares (about $105K) is paying at a minimum $1,458 and up to $2,331 per day to keep that short. That is a significant amount of money per day to hold short here, IMO.**

Moreover, those are ""per day"" fees that are incurred even when the market is closed.  So, roughly **$2.9K-4.6K to hold that short over the weekend**.  ***That's just bananas!*** *(see what I did there?)*

I know a lot of longs are scared ATM, but man when you look at those numbers time is really not on the side of shorts unless they can get those borrow fees down by scaring retail out of their positions.  I keep seeing people say September 27th some restricted shares unlock and add to the float, but that's not what I see in the SEC filings.

In the SEC filings it says that shares will not come on the market until 180 days after the merger was completed, which was Aug 27, 2021. So, that would mean **more shares are not coming on the market until Wednesday, February 23, 2022**. By then, shorts would easily have lost all gains made Friday and then some (if the borrow rate remains elevated).

TLDR: Australia decided to scrap a contract worth about $40Bn of submarines that they ordered from France. This has caused a bunch of big wig politicians to panic, but w/e we only care how to profit. 

Australia still wants some submarines to defend against China and instead plan to build at least 8 nuclear submarines from US/UK tech. The cost to equip an American Virginia-class nuclear submarine is about $3.4Bn/submarine, and some newer models $7Bn+. This is a decent chunk of money. 

Looking at US nuclear attack submarines, the only one's still being built are from a partnership between Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and General Dynamics (GD). I'm not sure how profits are shared here. 

Looking at UK nuclear submarines they are produced by BAE systems. 

I know very little about military contracts and even less about submarine production. Australia using US/UK tech should be beneficial to the company that owns the tech or is subcontracted in some way? I also believe in general a ramp up especially in submarine production due to conflicts in the South China Sea.

How do we profit from an arms race in the South China Sea and especially from this submarine contract mess?",19,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x292fae220>

Secondly I want to clarify, the trades I make are absolutely gambling.  I view them more as small bets at a craps table vs going all in on roulette.  It is possible to make money on both.  
I view options as a better tool for managing risk than leveraging into a huge position.  They can be used for both.  
With the strategy I mentioned in my previous post you are able to determine what level of risk you want to take.  I use thinkorswim and the ProbITM function to establish my risk level.  On the put side I look for the premium to be at least 10% of the strike price with a ProbITM below 40% and on the call side I just look for the smallest premium difference between strikes.

448,pqs0wz,1631990643.0,1npdydku,ghetto2000,US Government catalyst happening next week for weed stocks,"How the fck is nobody talking about the HUGE catalyst next week for the US cannabis sector??? Just kidding, of course nobody is talking about it because US weed stocks have been a messy late term abortion for the last 7 months. However, things are about to change in a BIG way. Lemme explain.

US MJ operators known as MSO (Multi State Operators) have to live in the shitty underworld of pink slip purgatory. They want to uplist to heaven (Nasdaq,NYSE). The SAFE Banking Act has potential to be the catalyst that will give MSO's their wings and uplist. Whats the SAFE Banking Act? It allows federal banks to work with plant-touching US MJ companies. Bankers have been lobbying congress for years because every greedy banker fck knows the weed industry is booming and they havent been able to wet their beak. The banks and tutes want in, SAFE is their gateway. Now begins the dice roll:

1. Last wednesday, Rep Perlmutter skillfully added SAFE to the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) as a proposed amendment. The NDAA has passed every year for the last 60 years (knock on wood). On Monday Sept 20th, the House Rules Cmte votes on the proposed amendments. Rep Perlmutter is on this cmte and all 13 members live in states with active rec and/or med weed. I give this a 90% chance of passing
2. Next up is the Senate. Once SAFE gets added to the NDAA, it gets sent to the Senate Armed Services Cmte. You'd think we'd be fcked from the sounds of it BUT 21 of the 26 members live in states with active rec and/or med weed. 8 members are co-sponsors of SAFE. Surprising all sounds like a slam dunk but Chucky Schumer might cause a mild stink about SAFE as he and Booker want all the shine from their comprehensive MJ bill created earlier this year. However, I think they take temperature of the room and will go with the bi-partisan win. No need to shoot down SAFE which is essential to establishing the financial plumbing for the industry when federal legalization occurs. I give this 60% chance of passing.
3. Ok cool. SAFE gets added in the Senate, the NDAA is voted, passed and signed in November. Now what about uplisting? SAFE does not have language for uplistings. The door is left open. Who will enter? FinCEN/AML. They have the authority to change the rules that allow MJ plant-touching businesses to access US equity markets. SAFE is the domino we need to trigger FinCEN/AML to update their regulatory guidance within 180 days. Because this is an unprecedented event and the ultimate prize, I will go with a 20% chance of happening which if it does will occur by the latest Q2/2022.

How to play this is with thru the tier 1 US MSO‚Äôs (Green Thumb, Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs, Verano Holdings) but you cant talk about them in here so for now go with TLRY, CGC since they have vested interests in the Tier 3 US MSO's (MedMen, Acreage Holdings). If uplisting occurs in Q2/2022 expect the media hype fest to begin. CNBC will be pump masters supreme celebrating weed like its the cumming of christ. The ponytail brothers will be hooting and hollering with unusual call activity. It will be a total FOMO shit show so saddle up now and get ready for the ride.

450,pqr1vg,1631987377.0,9ifs3n3i,David-SSS,Evergrande REIT,"Real estate in China represents around a fifth or a quarter of China's economy by most estimates.

China's Evergrande was once the country's second-largest real estate developer and is now drowning in debt. 

&#x200B;

Their financial woes are:

1. $305 billion debt
2. $7.4 billion bonds due in 2022
3. ***1.5 million unfinished properties***
4. 85% share price drop
5. New homes offered with 25% off

&#x200B;

Chinese state-media Global Times‚Äô editor-in-chief said on Thursday (Sept 16) that¬† Evergrande should use market means to save itself and should not bet on a government bailout as it deems itself ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù. 

Evergrande bankruptcy would trigger a systemic financial storm like Lehman Brothers, because it was a real estate business and the downpayment ratios in China were very high.

But nearly all the other bankers, analysts and investors interviewed say Beijing is in no mood for a Lehman moment. Rather than allow a chaotic collapse into bankruptcy, they predict regulators will engineer a restructuring of Evergrande's US$300 billion (S$404 billion) pile of liabilities that keeps systemic risk to a minimum. 

&#x200B;

Evergrande had 1.3 trillion yuan (S$270.8 billion) in pre-sale liabilities at the end of June, equivalent to about 1.4 million individual properties that it has committed to complete, according to a Capital Economics report last week.

If Evergrande had to dump its inventory onto the market"" it would ""drag down property prices substantially

&#x200B;

A significant slowdown in property construction over the next few years appears probable already, and would become even more likely in the event of an Evergrande failure or bankruptcy. A long-term slowdown in property construction, an industry that represents around a fifth or a quarter of China's economy by most estimates, would cause a significant decline in GDP (gross domestic product) growth, commodity demand, and would likely have disinflationary effects globally 

&#x200B;

While Evergrande is less of a whale onshore, a collapse could force banks to cut their holdings of corporate notes and even freeze money markets - the very plumbing of China's financial system. In such a credit crunch, the ***government or central bank would likely be forced to act***. Banks involved in property lending may come under pressure, leading to an increase in soured loans. Smaller banks exposed to Evergrande or other weaker developers may face ""significant"" increases in non-performing loans in the event of a default.

&#x200B;

In the coming weeks, we could see a government response to Evergrand upcoming crash. And if they come in an agreement with other banks to loan money to that company, we could probably see a brief squeeze with potential profits for international investors.

And if the chinese government don't support them, it could damage the country's image in honoring their debts. It would lead in a negative impact in a long term for the country's economy. And it would also make a domino effect like the Lehman brothers in 2008.",73,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x294bba910>

Someone commented on a $TMC hype post asking: what does this company even do?

After getting berated by WSB finest short squeezers with:

*‚Äúwe don‚Äôt ask questions here‚Äù*

*‚Äúdo we even care?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a tech company‚Äù*

*‚Äúthis may be the least important question on a thread I have ever seen‚Äù*

I had to say something.. so I responded *‚Äúmetals or something‚Äù*. I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future.

Regardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you‚Äôre not, here is why you should.

At the end of the day, we‚Äôre here to make money so lets go

2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.

None of this is financial advice, do your own DD.

I just learned how to read so if there‚Äôs mistakes let me know.

# 

# Part 1. metals or something

Check out the company website. Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their investor site, and 8K filings.

They have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope.

(Auto mod doesn't like the link, but it's metals dot co)

**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we‚Äôre fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.

**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport

What do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.

What‚Äôs the second thing they need? Metals.

Carbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires‚Ä¶ a fuck ton of metals.

The cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ushpohm7lao71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fc67ab4fc3a2042435d6451a4f8bc4bdf6b8691

These ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn‚Äôt the only thing scarred)

But these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely.

https://preview.redd.it/q3yodmw8lao71.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=def610525e2f4887be3908a05f9636c702046ab0

They contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it‚Äôs estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.

TMC‚Äôs main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:

[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/47y79v6alao71.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f34d44c47d8aeb948519866613d34ce41c2ee51)

It goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.

&#x200B;

>The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.

The NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world‚Äôs** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).

To put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.

And $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.

HOLY MOLY

That‚Äôs a lot of rocks.

Their plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they‚Äôre looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.

>Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus.¬†

&#x200B;

>Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.

But Junkyard-Razor74, don‚Äôt we have metals on land that we‚Äôre mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We‚Äôre trying to save it right? Rightttt?

[and that's just the beginning for climate spending](https://preview.redd.it/omfc8oxelao71.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=1678ebb747bb9286258c6558085f31fcce8a605b)

# Part 2. why it doesn‚Äôt matter (right now)

Information directly from form [8K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/) dated 9/15/2021.

DeepGreen Metals and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation¬†completed Their business combination and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker $TMC on Sept 10th, 2021.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, The Metals Company expects to receive approximately **$137.5 million** **in cash** prior to transaction fees, including $27.2 million of proceeds distributed from the trust account after accounting for redemptions and **$110.3** **million** of proceeds from PIPE investors in the private placement.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of DeepGreen:

The shareholders and the option holders of DeepGreen became entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for their DeepGreen Common Shares and options to purchase DeepGreen Common Shares, as applicable, an aggregate of **229,162,651 TMC Common Shares** (which includes TMC Common Shares underlying options).

Each Share is automatically convertible into TMC Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation entered into Subscription Agreements with certain investors (the ‚ÄúPIPE Investors‚Äù), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of **11,030,000 TMC Common Shares** at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of **$110,300,000** (the¬†‚ÄúPIPE Financing‚Äù).

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation also entered into Subscription Agreements for an aggregate of **22,000,000 Common Shares**, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of **$220,000,000** with two investors who defaulted on the Closing Date under the Subscription Agreements. The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.

**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising

* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders**
* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing
* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and‚Ä¶
* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.

Here‚Äôs the kicker:

**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.

Can‚Äôt sell them until blah blah blah.

**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.

**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**

WTF is a PIPE investor. See this great DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqexc0/spac_pipes_101_degens_playing_low_float_despacs/).

So you‚Äôre telling me that around 3.6 million shares have been shorted‚Ä¶ when SUPPOSEDLY the available public float is 2.7 million shares‚Ä¶

What am I missing here, are we all retarded? Did I actually learn how to read?

The short interest data of 3.6 million shares short **seems to be** from when the float was larger, before redemption. Most of them **should‚Äôve** covered. **IF** the short interest is the same then yes, the SI is over 100%+

I don‚Äôt even care about the short interest. It can be 30,000 or 3,000,000.

The public fucking float is **2.7 million shares**. According to the SEC filings and the CEO himself. Take a look: [Listen to the first 1 ¬Ω minutes](https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1438917219732312067?s=20).

Ballish!

**TL,DR:** The Metals Company is developing the world‚Äôs largest estimated source of battery metals, with enough nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese to electrify the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. They do this through innovative technology and deep-sea mining, which is healthier for our planet and lucrative for our pockets in the long term.

**TL,DR;TL,DR:** The float is 2.7 million everywhere you look. Confirmed again and again. Shorts + Calls ITM + Social Media Interest + hidden ballish divergence = Not enough shares to go around = Up

453,pqps2l,1631983182.0,a1nlo4ew,ShortChecker,What‚Äôs going on with you ‚Äúapes‚Äù complaining?,"Alright let me explain something.

People are on here complaining saying ‚Äúoh why are all these stocks being discussed‚Äù, WSB isn‚Äôt the same. ‚ÄúI remember when we used to only YOLO on solid fundamental companies like TSLA &amp; APPLE so that if you fucked up your trade at least your not bagholding‚Äù.

First off, shut the fuck up. I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2021, but do you even know what WSB is about?

It‚Äôs about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades ‚Ä¶ like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.

I‚Äôm not pushing $IRNT here, but I‚Äôm holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there‚Äôs something unique to come of it, ‚Äúpotentially‚Äù.

Fuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.

I‚Äôm in full exceptante of the L‚Äôs I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting ‚ÄúGaINs‚Äù or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.

People complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren‚Äôt even here back then.

You want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.

These types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.

For example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I‚Äôll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.

So, for me I‚Äôm rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here‚Äôs the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK ‚Ä¶ because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that‚Äôs on me and me only, there‚Äôs no one else to blame but myself and some of you are forgetting that.

DeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.

Plays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB rather then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.

There‚Äôs a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don‚Äôt ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn‚Äôt know why you got into  a trade.

This isn‚Äôt fucking Safe‚ÄîMoon you quacks. If that‚Äôs your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.

This is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.

Whether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Oversold, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.

If you can‚Äôt eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.

Sincere regards,

Edit: I want to be clear, I don‚Äôt post shit to receive awards or upvotes or any glorification about anything that I post. I post when I feel people don‚Äôt understand something or when I see an opportunity etc. I also read other redditors post for the same reasons.

This shit could get downvoted to oblivion and like I said, idgaf about Karma points etc. This is staying up unless a Mod takes it down. 

TL;DR - Don‚Äôt blame others for your decisions. There‚Äôs logical reasons why certain stocks apart from playing SPY weeklies etc are being traded on.",190,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x294d001f0>

Bears: We are in another tech bubble that will make the 2000 tech bubble look like child's play.

The BAG PIPE HOLDERS Are Coming For You! üëì,"**For anyone trading these high redemption, low float DeSPAC plays, the gravy train can last for a few weeks until PIPE shares hit the market. What are PIPEs? Read up below:**

https://preview.redd.it/rxbi3koal6o71.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f755c0f1fa5fd1fcc2888c0f26d09672e4c83b

**WHAT ARE PIPES?**

* PIPEs are Private Investments in Public Equity. PIPEs were a recent innovation in SPACs that allowed
   * A) sponsors to raise more capital outside of the dilutive sponsor promote,
   * B) provide a buffer to meet deal minimum cash conditions and
   * C) most importantly enable the separation of shareholder vote from redemption feature by addressing the minimum cash condition.
* Those last two points TRANSFORMED the SPAC market in that redemption-led vote failures became a thing of the past (a regular occurrence back in the day).
* By utilizing PIPEs, sponsors were able to raise enough capital for the target and give SPAC IPO investors the ability to vote for a deal while also redeeming their shares for $10 + interest.
* PIPE investors used to consist primarily of capital markets / direct investing / arbitrage desks of hedge funds. The goal of these funds were to make some reasonable return with the lowest possible risk.
* These investors may have demanded a discount to the $10 trust price, warrant coverage, convertible security, etc. These guys were not looking to take a fundamental bet on the company but were purely facilitators of capital.
   * BTW we are seeing a return of sweeteners for PIPE investors. Some examples: 890 5th Ave Partners / Buzzfeed (convertible notes), Seven Oaks / Boxed (convertible notes), Stable Road / Momentus (1 stock + 1 full warrant)
* Valuation of course did matter and PIPE investors helped provide a feedback mechanism of what was overvalued (I'M PASSING ON THIS!) and what was reasonable (OK, I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THIS DOWN).

**HOW HAVE PIPES CHANGED?**

* In earlier years the quality of sponsors and targets was spotty to say the least, however that started to change in 2020 as SPACs started becoming a more mainstream product attracting higher quality sponsors and targets. As a result of this, the structure and composition of PIPEs started to change.
* Higher quality, longer-term ""sticky"" money like Fidelity and Blackrock along with strategic investors started to participate in PIPEs.
* PIPE pricing also shifted from discounts/warrants/structured securities towards straight equity of $10 or even at a premium like Lucid or Enovix.

**SO HOW DO THEY MAKE / LOSE MONEY?**

* But hey these PIPE guys are making a lot of money RIGHT?! In good times and/or when they select the right deals, PIPE can be very lucrative. However, there is no free lunch for PIPE investors. While they do benefit from being ""brought over the wall"" to diligence potential SPAC targets before they are known to the public (a good source of those pesky leaks) and help set the valuation--as we've all seen, deals can and do fall below $10 at merger close.
* Once a PIPE investor makes a commitment to participate in a deal, they are LOCKED and LOADED. That hot electric vehicle company they thought would MEME but on close cratered? At deal close they have to wire the funds they committed and now they're looking at big losses.
   * \*Sometimes PIPE holders try to back out causing litigation like TMC where $220M of $330M PIPE investors decided to give the company a middle finger and walk away
* This may be fine for longer term or strategic PIPE investors, but for fast money hedge funds they will move quickly to cut losses. Hedge funds will look to short stock when allowed by the subscription agreement to ""box"" their long position and limit downside.
* When can hedge funds short against long PIPE shares? Check the subscription agreement filed (8-K) at the time of deal announcement.
   * It'll either explicitly state that PIPE investors can't short stock until deal close (most deals) or won't say anything which means PIPE investors CAN short stock anytime (e.g., Genius Sports, SoFi).
   * There are also hybrid structures out there like Mudrick / Topps (Rest In Peace) where PIPE holders could short up to 50% of their holdings prior to deal close if the stock was above $15.
* Back when SPACs were all working, these hedge funds may have let positions ""run"" and not hedged their positions. However given the recent market environment they're much more aggressive in locking in profits / mitigating losses.
   * Another wrinkle to this dynamic is that many SPACs have experienced high redemptions, which means there is no borrow to hedge against, which means further potential selling pressure once the PIPE shares are freely tradable (see below)
* When a deal closes and nears or breaks $10, perversely it forces the hedge funds to short causing more downward pressure. For the smart investor (such as you), you can take advantage of this technical selling to get into selective situations for cheaply.

**DeSPAC DEGENS READ THIS CLOSELY:**

* PIPE LOCKUP? For a vast majority of PIPEs, there are no lockups. Folks everywhere like talking about ""PIPE unlocks"", but what they are really referring to is when a PIPE is registered, effective and freely tradable. However, every deal is bespoke and some do include a rare lockup like Lucid.
* Typically, PIPE investors are only limited in selling their physical shares because they have to be registered via S-1 process.
   * The S-1 process usually goes like this:
      * 1: Post deal close initial S-1 is filed
      * 2: A few weeks later an amended S-1/A is filed
      * 3: Finally a 1-1.5 weeks later you'll see a 424B and EFFECT filed showing that the registration is effective and holders can sell
   * There may be a few amendments or sometimes the S-1 goes straight to being effective without any SEC comments. The whole S-1 process usually takes 45-60 days post closing.

**WHAT EFFECT DOES PIPE HEDGING HAVE?**

* One silver lining to the hedge funds shorting shares to box their long PIPE position - there won't be as much selling pressure from them once the S-1 goes effective because they're already ""flat"" and will close out their short position by collapsing w/ registered PIPE shares.
   * But remember, low-float SPACs have little or very unstable borrow which deters shorting to box PIPE shares
* Shorting prior to the S-1 going effective is not without risk. Borrow can get really tight leading to increasingly expensive cost and risk of recall. Just ask the guys that were short NKLA with unstable stock and covered at +$90 - yeesh. This is why many PIPE investors will seek stable ""term borrow"" and pay annualized rates of 10-30%.

**IN CONCLUSION:**

* PIPE investors are not all committed long-term investors, but they play a critical role in the capital raising function and valuation setting for SPACs. While it may not seem like they are on your side, they are more aligned with you than the sponsors!
* PIPE investor's role as a price discovery mechanism is part of the reason why we've seen a trickle of deals now, but those that are getting done are at more reasonable valuations.

**REREAD THIS - PIPE SHARES WILL COMING:**

* And to drive this point home, if you are playing high redemption, low-float deSPAC plays, don't overstay your welcome. Once you see the S-1 filed, the days of low float will soon be over after the PIPE shares go through the registration process and the BAG PIPE HOLDERS can finally sell.

**Possibly the truth:**

""Elon reached out to me and said, **look, I've got a bloody disaster on my hands, will you come and join us?** I joined the company and I checked out where they were at. I remember it vividly. After the first few days at Tesla, I went to see Elon at Space-X on a Friday and **he asked me: What do you think? I said Elon, it's a disaster. You're going to have to start again. He asked everything? I said yes, look, I know how to do this, let me design Model S from scratch. Elon asked: What, you mean nothing (can be saved)? I said if you want the best car, then trust me, it's from scratch. I thought well, he can only fire me, but he didn't, he said do it - and he meant it. He actually trusted me and empowered me to do it and we did do it.""** \- Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson on how he was tasked by Elon Musk to engineer the Tesla Model S.

# Background

$TMC - The Metals Company, CEO/Chairman Gerard Barron, a recent de-spac has is an interesting transition.

The original float of 300M has either been in lockup by original investors (e.g. PIPE, etc) or redeemed for cold hard cash. 90+% of the 30M available float has been redeemed for cash leaving us with a with a measly 2.7M float that, if you really pay attention, creates problems with liquidity and opens up the road for a **gamma squeeze**. Have any of you noticed the whack ass low volume? Or the ""Hard to Borrow"" designation from your brokers?

**The original thesis for this ticker was a gamma squeeze**, not a short squeeze. Not everything is a short squeeze. However, and this is a big however with a bag of salt, the recent fuckery around the de-spacs and people betting against the bulls have been building high short interest, compounding every day since Wednesday (9/15/21).

**A short squeeze is still unknown**, ***but the data suggesting its likelihood is increasing***. Cue double whammy cum rocket. But back to the original gamma squeeze idea:

This Friday (today) we were supposed to close above $12.50 to really fuck with MMs and ThetaGangers as there were way more calls than the public float could afford. (Sorry thetagang, I love you guys and I play both degenerate gambling and FD sales; this time I'm a degenerate).

u/ondori_co 's DD [has a pretty good breakdown of the shares](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppd4ei/the_tmc_dd_in_one_easy_to_read_chart/), with the exception that he did not breakdown the 12% SPAC and founder shares (30M) by accounting the cash redemptions. As previously stated, taking this into account gives us the 2.7M public share float that will be locked up until dilution.

Dilution? Yes dilution of the shares are presented in the SEC document stating that they will issue 5M more shares after trading above $15 dollars for 20+ days. The SEC filing also states further dilution at higher strikes after major upswings. Theoretically, until this company's shares are gamma or short squeezed (or naturally grows as a company), ***we are stuck with a 2.7M public share float.***

# Opinions

But we didn't close above $12.5 today, so the play is over right?  Those calls are worthless? Well **no and yes** there's a lot of hopium and copium at this point. The major shitting on MMs and bears at the guillotine won't happen today, but who knows what could happen next week? The volume of next months calls and November calls have increased exponentially. (Check me on that BTW, options volume can change rapidly.) ~~Bagholders~~ Diamond Hands who held on are **in for a lot of volatility** as everyone will keep saying. RIP to those who had calls expiring today like me, hopefully you took profits like a good and responsible degenerate or smart enough to buy calls expiring Oct/Nov.

I'll either be riding the gain train with you all or stockpiling tissues from having a good night with my homemade loss porn.

TL;DR / Position

* 300M Public Float? LIES.
* 2.7M Tradeable Public Float? TRUTH.
* Gamma Squeeze? THAT'S THE HOPE.
* Short Squeeze? MAYBE.
* Half-assed DD? PROBABLY.
* Positions? OCT 15 $11/$12.5 Calls

499,pqafty,1631918260.0,ngl0g,Araphoren,SDC - Dehedging the (tiny) float,"Are we done?

No, of course not.

Didn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations.

**Post summary (tldr)**

\- **Dehedge backfire:** Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.

\- **500% larger short interest than trading float:** Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest is at a 5 to 1 scale larger than daily trading float (less institutional filings).

\- **CTB spike predicts FTD regulation:** CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.

**Short strategies**

We're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.

Short playbook

1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today).
2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.

But... Didn't work so well. When price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.

[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&format=png&auto=webp&s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)

However, when the reverse happens and price breaks out - all those shorts become underwater. This is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.

**Constrained float**

This is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.

Turns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.

[Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)

**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)

**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)

**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**

Read that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless net institutions offload negatively against an equilibrium.

**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)

You read that right.

There are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.

[More crayons](https://preview.redd.it/hftm51m755o71.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f877a0800068d845c31bed37258c33e7fc5ce2b0)

&#x200B;

**Future FTDs? CTB is spiking.**

Almost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.

Here's the chart of CTB.

[CTB spike](https://preview.redd.it/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)

This is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.

In tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.

Already submitted my positions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppf22c/sdc_80k_yolo_45million_short_shares_aint_no_joke/) and have additionally bought 8,000 more shares at $6.72.
