The chart has spoken, we have defiled and devirginized that BLUE line which has ruled this ticker for since December. Let it be known that we have conquered, for now, and we may have squeezed a little but who knows where the price action will take us. Each one of you should have your own plans on when to add, lighten, sell or to diamond-hand. Each and everyone should follow their own respective plans, when to add, buy, lighten, sell or to diamond-hand. Congrats to everyone who made money. As what they say, be responsible with your own trades. Till we chart again!

When it does, I‚Äôm curious as to what companies some of you chimps would short the fuck out of. I‚Äôve never shorted, but I kinda wanna try it. 

Anyway, if you guys were gonna short a company, what would you short? Personally, I would short the fuck out of spirit airlines

#Trade setup for spy  today

**Spy having a 4 odd percent rally in very short span might see some consolidation, but not much downside for puts to print. Trading range for spy is between 437 on lower end and 447 on upper today, if by chance it crosses 447 and sustains it is an indication for a new ath incoming and a clear signal for long callls**
