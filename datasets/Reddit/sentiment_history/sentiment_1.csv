  My first post as news got refused, maybe this has already been talked about before but I havenâ€™t personally seen a post on it.

We want to help new investors/traders. That's definitely one of the main goals of this community. We don't want to run people off, but at the same time we want there to at least be some sort of standard to what constitutes ""low effort."" We wish to differentiate between legitimate, detailed questions predicated upon at least a base level of due diligence and questions that may be better served going into an ""other folder,"" so to speak.

Also to note, anything that fits the description of what goes in this thread will be deleted from the ""main sub,"" so there may be a learning curve of people wondering why their posts are getting deleted. This new format sticky thread will be auto re-posted daily so as not to get too cluttered.

The following is a list of what is relegated to this ""catch all"" thread, and is subject to change based on the needs of the sub:

1. What broker should I use?
2. What do you guys think of ""XXXX"" stock?
3. Should I buy or sell ""XXXX"" stock?
4. Any threads with ZERO DD
5. Anything that would have gone into the ""any stocks go here"" sticky thread (cryptocurrency is still banned)
6. Any questions you think might be ""stupid"" questions
7. Any post requesting people's thoughts on your thoughts",1,"['lounge', 'noob', 'effort']
