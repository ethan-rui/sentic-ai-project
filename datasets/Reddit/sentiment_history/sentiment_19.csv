\--------------

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M.  Shares have been up 8-10% after hours.  I personally can't remember the last time BB had a revenue beat.

**Customer wins:**

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BB Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance it closes/gets announced this quarter (before year end)

**IVY + Amazon (IoT and the Connected Car):**

AUTO IVY will be available October 2021 Beta much sooner than expected and will have embedded battery efficiency and Payment platform Apps

**PAPA Chen delivering on QNX software in 24/25 of the leading OEM car companies**

**BlackBerry hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry's cyber security business unit:**

**Chart looks like a ""Gap and Go"" short squeeze in the short term, and over the medium term we have the Facebook patent sale/partnership news catalyst coming before the end of the year.**

**BlackBerry still Severely undervalued compared to competitors and has so much upside**

**Conclusion = As Cathie Wood said about Tesla... ""I LOVE THIS SET UP"" (Buy BlackBerry!)**  üöÄ

&amp;#x200B;

* SOFI mentions soared today after the stock price provided solid returns to shareholders today, up 11% for the day.
* SDC momentum is carrying over from the last couple weeks. This seems to be the next ""short-squeeze"" stock you folks like.
* BB took off after-hours and was up 11% at one point, but is now up 6%.
* FB stock slid down 4%, which is unusual for a blue chip operated by none other than Mr Zuckerberg. As the WSB saying goes ""you cant cuck the zuck"" and so WSBers were buying the dip.
* LCID slid 7% down today, but that's okay because the stock went up 10% the day before.

Here's the data of ticker mentions throughout the day, visualized. We can see the exact moment BB took off after-hours and when SOFI reall started to pick up momentum.

Here are the rest of the top tickers being mentioned on WSB and some of  their current returns. Other than a few of the recent memers going down it was a great day for WSB!
