[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw6nkg/tsla\_to\_aths\_and\_your\_account\_can\_be\_too\_if\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw6nkg/tsla_to_aths_and_your_account_can_be_too_if_you/)

I'm here again to tell you that this thing is not over. If you thought it was too late, think again. TSLA is on the verge of breaking the big psychological barrier of $800 and once it does so, it will be running to upper $800s or even the ATH of $900. See chart below.

As mentioned in my previous post, and as seen in early 2021 of the chart above, TSLA tends to breakout with strength. And by strength, I mean the strong possibility of 15%-20% weeks. It is possible that this week will be one of those weeks if TSLA can break the psychological $800 barrier. Lets do this together and lets all make some money here while helping out daddy Elon.

And if you're still on the fence, remember that TSLA is more than just an EV company. They years ahead of most EV companies out there and have their foot in the door of the power station industry, AI industry, Solar industry, etc. This is one of the most cutting edge companies out there and their valuation reflects how strongly investors feel about their growth in the future. Cheers to all who are able to make money!
