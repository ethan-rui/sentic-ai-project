‚Äã

In light of China‚Äôs recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe‚Äôs strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.

But this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.

They reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.

EPS

Even if this ER is about forward guidance, there‚Äôs a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe‚Äôs first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts‚Äô average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won‚Äôt have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn‚Äôt work out that way, but it‚Äôs entirely plausible.

Revenue

Regarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let‚Äôs ignore the facts that

* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),
* Paysafe‚Äôs Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar‚Äôs, DraftKings and Penn,
* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,
* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: ‚ÄúWe continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.‚Äù
* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).

Rather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe‚Äôs Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe‚Äôs own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).

Paysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1‚Äô20, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We‚Äôve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.

Analysts‚Äô average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there‚Äôs a very good chance that they‚Äôll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.

As a long-term investor, I‚Äôll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.

Last quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe‚Äôs already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.

This confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.

Recent Price Action

As Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe ""has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.""

Over the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.

\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe‚Äôs data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\] But I digress.

While the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F‚Äôs show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.

Bottom?

Whoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.

The current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, ‚Äúcross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.‚Äù

M&amp;A / inorganic growth

Along the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, ‚Äúan aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.‚Äù

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe‚Äôs strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù 6,9

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: ‚ÄúFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe ‚Äì an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.‚Äù

Rounding out the Picture:

\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe‚Äôs proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted ‚ÄúBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Processor of the Year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Payment Method.‚Äù

Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted ‚ÄúBest Digital Wallet‚Äù for ‚Äúbest consumer take up‚Äù, ‚Äúmost innovative technology‚Äù with ‚Äúgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.‚Äù

Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe‚Äôs digital wallet Skrill as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as ‚ÄúAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12

iGaming Expansion

It's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). ‚ÄúAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.‚Äù

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe‚Äôs expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don‚Äôt realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.

As Bill Foley says, ""we‚Äôre seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It‚Äôs going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that‚Äôs headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We‚Äôve got a wide landscape we can attack. It‚Äôs pretty exciting‚Äù

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: ‚ÄúWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.‚Äù

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, ‚ÄúPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,‚Äù

Del Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, ‚Äúwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.‚Äù 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:

Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a ""BUY""

Some quotes :

RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: ‚ÄúWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.‚Äù ‚Äúrecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE‚Äôs business and the FTAC II transaction‚Äù and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: ‚ÄúPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it‚Äôs this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.‚Äù 4

RBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: ‚ÄúOur positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it‚Äôs a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it‚Äôs the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.

BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: ‚ÄúPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE‚Äôs revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.‚Äù iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow ‚Äúat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world‚Äù with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" 3

Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its ‚Äúrobust risk management operation,‚Äù and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2

MOAT: ‚Äúrobust risk management operation‚Äù

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : ‚ÄúWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players‚Ä¶we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can‚Äôt do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we‚Äôre not only talking about take rates and comps, we‚Äôre talking about revenue-generation, we‚Äôre talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That‚Äôs a really, really powerful position to have.‚Äù 9

Valuation

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),

By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the ‚Äúmid to high teens.‚Äù But even if you include 2020‚Äôs stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal‚Äôs current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

## Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

‚Äã

## More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

‚Äã

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe‚Äôs conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

This is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I‚Äôve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.

4,8,8,pelejh,2021-08-30,wall_street_buoy,$LEV Lion Electric - The next Affirm and Rivian's older brother that you didn't know about,"First of all, [u/RossPG](https://www.reddit.com/user/RossPG/) rocks man! His [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p50n5p/amzn_is_up_to_something_with_afrm_obsessive_dd/) on Affirm was so spot on. Gems like these make WSB such an amazing place!

I will try to keep the post as concise as possible and link to verifiable sources so that the reader can research and draw conclusions on their own.

# Introduction

Lion Electric is a Canadian-based manufacturer of commercial vehicles founded in 2008. It is the North American leader in all-electric medium and heavy duty urban vehicles. It designs and assembles the vehicles in-house and is vertically integrated (from battery design and assembly, charging network, to vehicle software and monitoring).

# The Amazon angle

Let's start with the elephant in (every) room, Amazon. While Amazon is going to work with Rivian to build the last mile delivery trucks, it is going to procure up to 2,500 all-electric Lion 6 and Lion 8 trucks from Lion Electric by 2025. Amazon has a [contract](https://www.electrive.com/2021/01/11/huge-order-for-lion-electric-trucks-from-amazon/) with Lion Electric which provides for the reservation of production capacities at Lion Electric  for up to 500 e-trucks per year between 2021 and 2025. The contract order also states that Lion Electric will keep 10% of its production facility free from 2026 to 2030 to supply at least 500 electric trucks per year. Lion Electric has already delivered the first production batch to Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lion's all Electric Amazon delivery trucks ](https://preview.redd.it/i5xrpt55pik71.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e771246e56a14969833763c7ae4aae741b0da8d)

To get over all the negative press Amazon is getting, its focusing heavily on showing its positive environmental impact (including some desperate [efforts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-25/amazon-to-rename-seattle-s-keyarena-climate-pledge-arena) like buying Seattle's KeyArena and renaming it to Climate Pledge Arena!).

The SEC filing which Lion Electric had filed earlier this year also included an option for Amazon to purchase common shares  of Lion Electric at $5.66 and **warrants to purchase shares at $23.36**. **The  full vesting of the warrants requires spending by Amazon of at least  $1.1 billion annually. Amazon could own 20% of Lion Electric in the  future with its ownership options.**

([SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/1834974/000119312521035605/d916282dex109.htm): Although most of the document is super dense, you could search for ""SCHEDULE OF TERMS OF WARRANT SHARES"")

# The Rivian connection

Coincidence that Lion Electric chose Juliet, Illinois as their manufacturing plant in USA? Less than 100 miles from Rivian's facility in Normal, IL?  ([ref](https://www.onlineev.com/rivian-and-lion-electric-vehicle-plants-make-illinois-a-potential-hub/))

Rivian is supposed to be delivering last mile all-electric delivery vehicles for Amazon whereas Amazon has contract with Lion for medium/heavy duty vehicles.  Amazon has supported Rivian through all its delays and remains heavily invested in it. There will be a lot of synergy &amp; partnership between Rivian and Lion Electric since Lion Electric has been in business for a long time and has many production vehicles on road. We will know more about it when Rivian SEC filings. Rivian has been in pre-production phase and will look up to its older brother for production expertise. Elon Musk has [mentioned](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1389102532706848768) time and again that prototyping is way easier than actually making production vehicles. Lion Electric has been designing and making production vehicles for quite some time and Amazon would be more than happy to take advantage of its relationship with Lion Electric to propel Rivian.

# OK so what's Lion Electric on its own?

Lion Electric has more than 400 production vehicles on road with approximately 8 million miles driven. Announced in Q2 earnings call ([ref](https://s27.q4cdn.com/902820926/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Earnings-Presentation-v20.pdf)), it has an order book of more than $280 million dollars worth of all-electric medium and heavy duty urban vehicles. Clients include IKEA, First Student, (the largest student transportation provider in North America) who recently ordered 260 all-electric buses for pilot, LA School District etc.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lion's vehicles along with its current customers](https://preview.redd.it/1x6v6swfpik71.png?width=1701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62fd40b3aed46056797b0e7a22aa9f8da851d13)

Lion Electric has also successfully deployed vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging in a pilot program. This opens up potential revenue streams for its customers. Lion's buses and heavy-duty vehicles come equipped standard with V2G technology, providing opportunities for its customers to sell electricity back to the grid when demand for energy is high. ([ref](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/lion-electric-announces-successful-electric-school-bus-vehicle-to-grid-deployment-with-con-edison-in-new-york-869214579.html))

Lion Electric is targeting a TAM of $110 billion dollars.

**Production Facilities:**

Its current factory in Montreal has a capacity to produce 2500 vehicles. It is also building a 1.6 million sq ft battery plant in Quebec, Canada with a planned annual capacity of 5 gigawatt hours aimed to power up to 14,000 Lion vehicles.

For customers in USA (\*cough\* Amazon \*cough\*), it is building USA's largest all-electric medium &amp; heavy duty vehicle plant in Joliet, Illinois, USA which is about 80% complete and will have a production capacity of 20000 vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other tailwinds:**

Lion Electric has a lot of support from Canada government. Both at the state and federal level. Canada is also pushing a lot on the electric bus &amp; truck infrastructure ([ref](https://electrek.co/2021/03/05/canada-announces-2-75-billion-investment-in-zero-emissions-buses-and-charging-infrastructure/)). In USA, although we don't have anything concrete yet, Biden's trillion dollar infrastructure bill has a lot of meat for Lion Electric and its competitors. Lion Electric also has been working very closely with local and state government authorities to sell electric school buses. Illinois gave Lion Electric $8 million incentive to setup their factory in Illinois [(ref)](https://www.onlineev.com/rivian-and-lion-electric-vehicle-plants-make-illinois-a-potential-hub/). Recently, LA school district (which is the largest school district in California) also started a pilot project with Lion Electric. ([ref](https://ir.thelionelectric.com/English/news/news-details/2021/Lion-Electric-to-Bring-Zero-Emission-School-Buses-to-Californias-Largest-School-District/default.aspx))

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation:**

**$LEV is currently trading at a market cap of 2.2 B**. It is projecting $0.7 Billion revenue in 2022, $1.6 Billion in 2023 and $3.6 Billion is 2024 growing at an average rate YOY of more than 240%.

At $3.6 billion in fiscal 2024 &amp; 20,000 in annual vehicle sales, $LEV is trading at a forward 4-year price to sales revenue multiple of 0.5x.

*Meanwhile, Rivian is IPOing at 80 B valuation...*

# tl;dr

Ape thinks Lion Electric is highly undervalued (both long term and short term) given its current sales, its growth trajectory and its Amazon connections. It will go astronomical when Rivian files IPO.

**Positions:**

Long term: 200 01/20/23 15C 

Short term lottos: 100 Oct 15 15C

5,13,13,peloe0,2021-08-30,coolcomfort123,PayPal is exploring a stock-trading platform for its U.S. customers,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/paypal-is-looking-to-launch-a-stock-trading-platform-for-its-customers.html

PayPal is exploring ways to let users trade individual stocks, according to two sources familiar with the plan, and public details around a new executive hire.

As part of that expansion, the payment giant hired a brokerage industry veteran to lead ‚ÄúInvest at PayPal‚Äù -- a previously unreported division of the payments giant.

The move comes amid a retail trading boom that brought millions of new investors into the stock market, and more regulatory scrutiny for some brokerage firms.

This is a definitely good news for paypal. It is the best fintech play and the customer bases are growing very healthy. By adding the stock trading platform, it can attract more customers assets and able to generate more revenue.",2,"['platform']

6,18,18,pembbo,2021-08-30,natery5,"I made a lot of money on GME and quit my job, but I'm not sure whether to pay off my debt or keep daytrading with a lot of money","Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:

- $20k
- $10k
- $6k from my girlfriend
- $4k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?
