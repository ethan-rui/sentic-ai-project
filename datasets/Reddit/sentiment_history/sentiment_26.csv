7,23,23,poaah7,2021-09-14,MaryAustin24,Could EverQuote (EVER) use some love?,"EverQuote is a free service which matches consumers with an insurance provider. They started off with car insurance and have expanded into health, life and home. 

They were founded by a couple of guys from MIT. 

Their revenue is driven by lead generation for insurance companies. Expanding into new vertices should help bolster their revenue growth. They also have a big opportunity with generating ad revenue.  This space is growing at a much higher clip and should give them even more upside. 

Their market cap is $625M. Their full year 2021 revenue is projected to be around $445M.  
Stock has a low float, sub 20M. 

This isn’t a short squeeze candidate or anything like that. It seems to have fallen off the radar and I’m hoping it’s at the beginning of a reversal to the upside. It might be worth a look. 

This is not financial advice. 

Position: 500+ shares at an average of $24.60. Currently trading at $21.45. 

This is my first post here and I’m scared! Please don’t hurt me.",1,"['use', 'love']
