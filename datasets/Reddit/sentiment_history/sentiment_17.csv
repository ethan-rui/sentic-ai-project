I put this together as a token of recognition to all the diamond hands across reddit worldwide.  For all you smooth and wrinkled brains, new apes and old apes, veteran WSB or not, retail investor or retard investor, millennial or boomer, x apes, xx, xxx, or xxx+.   we all invested in growth and growth is here.   GME and AMC have endured and established as a symbol of market freedom, amazing customer driven companies and opportunity to profit in a meaningful way.

Kudos to you all for saving a business and unleashing a new platform for GME and as well as an ever evolving movies experiences (and yes, free popcorn too).

This is not financial advice; it is just a symbol of gratitude to the reddit community, the MODs, the diligent apes bringing DD and memes.   Thanks and gratitude with a great song vibe but also an anthem to celebrate the journey so far.

Always remember:

""Patience is free. To cover is NOT""

**NOTE**: until this date no-one has refuted WSB, GME, DDintoGME, AMC, AMCstock, GMEJungle WSBafterhours,etc.   

Retail investors can, by diamond handin', become a new generation of wealthy (hopefully kinder) apes that buy and hold and, more importantly, invest in companies we love.

Kudos to the executive teams from GME and AMC.  You have an important mission and retail trusts you.  

P.S. hedgies, you still gotta cover ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸš€

# TLDR:

As analysts, we can always point out the bad things in a company, but the hard part in the market, is to find value where others do not. This comes with a caveat though, because it is not enough to think different, we also need to be right when others are wrong, and it is quite hard to be right against the market.

There are at least three options (or a combination of them), which AMC has, in order to revitalize the business and sustain the current $21b market cap:

* Get a technology or streaming company to acquire the business and improve with their help
* Shrink the business and operate theaters that have been or are the most profitable
* Improve the business by digitalization, attuning to local specifications of clients, and trying out other screening activities like e-sports, gaming etc.

# The ideas for improvement:

The **first** option is acquisition, so let's get that out of the way. This involves a large streaming competitor coming in, and introducing a hybrid business model between streaming and cinema. They would benefit from using the AMC brand name, a positive PR move, and giving their audience a chance to buy cinema tickets for their favorite shows from their platform. Assuming the acquirer does machine learning right, they might be able to use their statistics to show movies that will generate more revenues.

Acquisitions are very risky, and hard to get right. But it might give shareholders the chance to profit on their investment. In some sense, they are buying the favor of the many people that still hold the stock, which may be worth something on its own.

Just imagine what would happen to the stock price if someone announced they want to buy the company.

The **second** option I will propose is a bit opposite to what management has been promoting lately. Instead of expanding, AMC should look at shrinking to value.Â 

AMC has a lot of theaters in the U.S. and worldwide. The company has some 14 thousand employees. It stands to reason, that not all of these outlets have the same profitability. There is a good chance that management knows very well which theaters are the most profitable, and can consider maximizing value by cutting out the costly ones.

This will make the company more manageable, less risky and more profitable. It will also cut expenses and make cinema a more exclusive activity.

The **third** option concerns the business model. It is obvious that the company needs to digitalize better - even their main website has some basic bugs that are annoying (some automated guide that cannot be turned off). But the main question is: Is there some alternative way of utilizing theater capacity, that is perhaps cheaper, and will attract more guests?

While it differs among cultures, cinema has been a way to spend leisure time with friends, family and loved ones. If AMC has a specific type of customer that is more prone to going to their theaters, it might consider extra activities that are specifically catered to that type of guest. Perhaps it can do some A/B testing for the ambient and figure out what works on a local level. It can also offer some more supplementary products, like selling board games or quick photo snaps for guests by a professional photographer as part of their AMC experience.Â 

Alternatively, it may try offering some alternative media on the big screen, like e-sports, gaming runs, or movie auctions by popular demand. The last one simply means that people have a local movie wish-list and get notified of a screening once enough people express interest.

Finally, whatever the game plan is, shareholders need to know it. It is on management to paint a clear path to profitability for the company - it does not need to happen tomorrow, but investors need to know what to expect on the long term.",1,"['negative', 'write', 'turn']
