Evil corporations have been planning and building for a future where everything happens digitally because boomers destroyed the planet and refused to admit they could create a sustainable future without dirty oil money. In order for this transition to the metaverse to occur, we have to have accurate depictions of interiors with 3D depth that you can perceive naturally. Enter Matterport. Their technology allows just that. Not only do they have a SEVERE market advantage in the real estate sector, but they have utility as an NFT company. Their goal is to digitally map real structures for you to experience from your couch. Like the matrix but without the computer overlords. 

Take some time to really navigate around these demos: 

[Lambo Dealer](https://matterport.com/gallery/lamborghini-mexico-city)

[Super Yacht](https://matterport.com/gallery/horizon-fd92-hull-19)

One of the coolest parts is that inside each of these you can interact with data points and perform actions like measurements etc. Imagine what utilities it will have in 10 years. 


Itâ€™s no coincidence they map lambo dealers, super yachts, and mansions. Their stock is going to help us all buy them.

I went to look up Chik-Fil-A and they are forever going to be a private company. Should I short Wendy's, then buy the dip? Or just settle down and invest in a Chik-Fil-A franchise? 

I'm growing tired of meme stocks and thought this was a true opportunity to get in on good news.
