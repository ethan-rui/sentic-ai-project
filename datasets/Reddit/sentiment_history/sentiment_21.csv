I’m a bit of a gay bear scout, if you will. This morning I bought some long VIX calls, because this shit has the potential to get bad. I sold two a few hours in, and a bit later I find that (I’m a separate sell order) that RH sold the rest of my positions without my permission. The contracts I used to have are triple price now. Seriously, please pull all your cash out.",1,"['need', 'reason', 'ditch']
