It was due to them and the non stop short attack that the stock tanked from $20s to 6s back in March. With the main bear thesis now gone, all signs point towards a return to $10+ with due to the non stop positive news releases and ~400m cash on hand. 

With this announcement thereâ€™s not much stopping it from skyrocketing on Tuesday at market open, since all of Carson blockâ€™s followers will be racing to close their short position as well.
