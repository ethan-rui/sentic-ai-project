Goldman downgraded them to a price target of $2.50 (well below other targets) then proceeded to buy millions of shares. LLNW had just bought a company called Layer0, which will add tremendous value for them, but the downgrade did not include that in their analysis. Goldman just moderated an interview with LLNW's CEO and CFO, and I predict will very soon announce a stock upgrade and issue a new price target, likely in the $7-$10 range. The whole downgrade was solely so their trading arm could load the boat then issue new guidance, this time including the acquisition. It's total BS, but also extremely transparent and easy to take advantage of by loading up now. LLNW closed today at, believe it or not, $2.50. They have a market cap of only $300 million and will do $250 million in revenue this year. They have a new CEO this year making great improvements.

Both the short interest and the short borrow fee look high enough to trigger a squeeze.

$BODY expects to post revenues between $930 million and $960 million in 2021 and as the company has a market cap of $1.9 billion, this gives it a price-to-sales multiple of around 2x. Peloton trades at a 2021 price-to-sales multiple of around 5x.

Analysts have a bullish forecast for $BODY stock and it has three buys and one hold rating. Its median target price of $11.25 is a premium of almost 81 percent. The stock trades 45 percent below the street low target price of $9.

$BODY listed through a three-way merger with FRX and MYX Fitness. The stock made a 52-week high of $18.20 before the merger. However, around the merger date in June, it fell below $10. Like a typical SPAC merger, the stock rose after the merger date but soon tumbled. Currently, BODY stock trades very near its 52-week lows.

David Tepper's Appaloosa takes new positions in $BODY Company with 2.0M shares

With all the above and the announcement of BODI, Beachbody’s new live interactive content subscription offering, launching in September which will strengthen the company even more not only is a short squeeze possible but the fundamentals are great also.

$BODY expects to post revenues between $930 million and $960 million in 2021 and as the company has a market cap of $1.9 billion, this gives it a price-to-sales multiple of around 2x. Peloton trades at a 2021 price-to-sales multiple of around 5x.

Analysts have a bullish forecast for $BODY stock and it has three buys and one hold rating. Its median target price of $11.25 is a premium of almost 81 percent. The stock trades 45 percent below the street low target price of $9.

$BODY listed through a three-way merger with FRX and MYX Fitness. The stock made a 52-week high of $18.20 before the merger. However, around the merger date in June, it fell below $10.

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  
G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always, don't listen to me. Do your own research. 

Invest in Banana Futures.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  
G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)

But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples.

\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  
G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  
G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always, don't listen to me. Do your own research.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  

[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  
G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)

\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense.

It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.

D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.

For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)

\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example

People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

I say “most likely” in the title because you never know what might happen, but if I was a betting man I would go all in that it’s this week.

Things we know: 

Sept. 13th was the deadline for the SPA (stock purchase agreement).

There was a chance of an extension until Sept. 28th.

The extension was only allowable under the case that financing was secured and that TLSS had written proof of the secured financing.

Things we can comfortably presume:

There was an extension. John (CEO) has never taken two weeks to file an 8-K, therefore we can assume there was an extension.

With an extension, the deal is all but completed. We are just waiting on the financing to process. At that point, the deal is done. I feel comfortable saying the deal is going to be completed soon if not already.

The announcement should be sometime this week. I, again, feel comfortable saying it will be this week. There is the “4 business day” rule of an 8-K after an acquisition which technically gives John until Oct. 4th, however that is the very last day to file. Chances are better that the filing happens sometime this week. 

Just to give context to what happens with a 100M revenue acquisition, look at $HRAA. I know they had a reverse merger and it’s not an exact comparison with different amounts of outstanding shares, but they jumped from around $0.04 to $0.42. TLSS probably won’t jump that high with as many O/S as they have, but it’s safe to say that a $0.06-$0.10 jump is possible.

To summarize, we can comfortably conclude that the deal WILL be completed and that we should be notified this week. Make sure to buy while the shares are cheap. Any questions, feel free to ask, and thanks for your time.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.

So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below   
**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  
A1) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.   
This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.   
B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.   
B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.   
B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)  
But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together.   
Sandy Munro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU  
B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey.  It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.   
C) GM appears to be Morons  
These people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?  
Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations. 

https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/  
D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)  
This is a great problem to have in most circumstances.   
If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.   
E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.   
Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  
Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.   
[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  
For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years. 

  
F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)  
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  
\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,

I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)

I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock.  HODL until 2024, stock price or year. 

This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.   
Notes:  
1.  All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.   
2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split. 

  
**Tesla Advantages**  
A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.  
No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.  
(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)  
For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.   
B) Software/Over the Air  
In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.   
C) Software based UI  
Less buttons, cables, supply chain.   
The cost is in the supply chain.   
People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.   
The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.   
D) Supercharger Network.  
Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.   
E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.  
[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  
F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.  
The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.   
G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons.  
People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans.  Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.   
As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.   
H) The potential EV market is huge.

Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs.   
Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.   
G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together.   
In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.   
H) The ""Model 2"" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.   
I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.   
(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  
J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.  
[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  
K) Seamless Supercharging.  
Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  
**Disadvantages**  
A) Non-FSD chip Supply  
(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  
B) FUD in the media.  
Example:  
Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks.   
Here is an example.   
Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits.  \*\* Math Below

G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.   
Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells  
ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons.   
Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars.   
HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back.  
Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)

\*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  
[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  
People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.  
Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  


Less Income = Less Taxes.  
Income from Reg Credits is taxed.

555 income before taxes  
186 paid in taxes  
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.  
555 - 397  
= \~158

158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.

The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.

As always, don't listen to me. Do your own research. 

Invest in Banana Futures.

I think we'll see a big turnaround in $BEST inc's stock price in the foreseeable future; not financial advice obviously, but I really like what I'm seeing here; and I'll continue to be long and strong on $BEST inc.

Here in this paragraph, Sina Weibo mentions that $BEST is ""very valuable"" and that there's signs of mergers and acquisitions. I'm bullish!

I think we'll see a big turnaround in $BEST inc's stock price in the foreseeable future; not financial advice obviously, but I really like what I'm seeing here; and I'll continue to be long and strong on $BEST inc.

Good luck, friends.

So I saw this interesting article on Sina Weibo which discussed $BEST; this paragraph stood out for me:

""*It is not surprising that there are rumors that Best is going to sell its express delivery business. At present, the price of Best's stock has increased significantly, and the transaction volume is also large. According to Double One's judgment,* ***it is expected that there will be signs of mergers and acquisitions***\*.\* ***As for who is behind the buyer, this is not important, what is important is that Best's express license and the shell of the listed company are still very valuable***\*.\*"" - Sina Weibo

Here in this paragraph, Sina Weibo mentions that $BEST is ""very valuable"" and that there's signs of mergers and acquisitions. I'm bullish!

I think we'll see a big turnaround in $BEST inc's stock price in the foreseeable future; not financial advice obviously, but I really like what I'm seeing here; and I'll continue to be long and strong on $BEST inc.

Good luck, friends.

That said, it may be a potential target for someone. Decent portfolio of production and just got more acreage in the hot hanyesville area where there have recently been quite a bit if merger/acquisitions due to the proximity to LNG export ports. Recently, CHK bought Vine. Southwestern bought Indigo. Geosouthern is reportedly in talks (hopefully with Tellurian). Rockcliff had a closed bid on haynesville assets last month. Lots of activity in the region and nat gas industry. 

Nat gas prices are on fire across the globe. While export from US is the best play IMO, small companies like PHX will likely be indirect beneficiaries through possible buyouts. Floor will be in place if Henry Hub holds around $4 or $5.

Its a simple/easy way when your kid doesn't get the gift they want.  Also Roblox is not a video game, its a content creation platform.

Kids are designing products and companies are pushing the most successful in the platform (partnerships are going to roar)..  No need for market research/advertising when its on a platform all for FREE!.  Also Disney is snooping around, Imagine putting Disney in every kids home around the world.  A virtual world, that brainwashes them and when those kids grow up they will want to go to real disney.  FLYWHEEL.

488,488,1382,1382,1382,pv5ycr,2021-09-25,SuperNewk,After My Pick in QS I give you the next XMAS Blockbuster ROBLOX,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pt8kiq/qs\_quantumscape\_is\_set\_up\_to\_surprise/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pt8kiq/qs_quantumscape_is_set_up_to_surprise/)

QuantumScape is/was a nice bet in poker.  You get pocket Aces, you play them. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOW we get a bigger prospect, ROBLOX.  Why a kids video game you might be thinking.. CNBC was saying 'ZOMG supply chain ruined you can't get toys or gifts for xmas it will be miserable''

&amp;#x200B;

NO you fools, it will be a digital XMAS!  Parents are already giving their kids weekly allowances for RBLX.  for XMAS GME is prepping for a lot of gift cards for ROBUX.  

&amp;#x200B;

Its a simple/easy way when your kid doesn't get the gift they want.  Also Roblox is not a video game, its a content creation platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Kids are designing products and companies are pushing the most successful in the platform (partnerships are going to roar)..  No need for market research/advertising when its on a platform all for FREE!.  Also Disney is snooping around, Imagine putting Disney in every kids home around the world.  A virtual world, that brainwashes them and when those kids grow up they will want to go to real disney.  FLYWHEEL.  

&amp;#x200B;

Its a genius platform, that could become the next classroom for kids, from finance/coding all while in a gaming friendly atmosphere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck place your bets accordingly.  If the Stock holds up here we are looking at close to 125-150 by Xmas.  Not as much upside as QS but its a solid bet.  I predict it 10x's in under 5 years too.",1,"['pick', 'give', 'xmas', 'blockbuster']

I was intrigued by the tiny market cap of $83M. *Low liquidity and volume should be noted*. Anyway, I got sidetracked looking to PHX bc they have 250k acres of oil and gas production spread throughout the US. They are not focused  on the Haynesville area only (so I am not sure if they fit the profile that I was looking for with regard to TELL). 

That said, it may be a potential target for someone. Decent portfolio of production and just got more acreage in the hot hanyesville area where there have recently been quite a bit if merger/acquisitions due to the proximity to LNG export ports. Recently, CHK bought Vine. Southwestern bought Indigo. Geosouthern is reportedly in talks (hopefully with Tellurian). Rockcliff had a closed bid on haynesville assets last month. Lots of activity in the region and nat gas industry. 

Nat gas prices are on fire across the globe. While export from US is the best play IMO, small companies like PHX will likely be indirect beneficiaries through possible buyouts. Floor will be in place if Henry Hub holds around $4 or $5.

Good day everyone,  


We are continuing coverage on **Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCY),** a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company.  


Current price $3.12/share (at 2:15 PM EDT 9-23-21)  


BTCY is expanding its presentation of its product line, including the new Biokit product. Biokit is a wirelessly connected personal medical device kit that was developed to address the challenges with existing home-based medical devices. The kit, which complements the Bioflux cardiac-diagnostic offering, addresses the $18.4 billion-dollar North American portable medical device market.  


The company CEO presented its products yesterday at the Oppenheimer Fall Healthcare Life Sciences &amp; MedTech Summit.  


Our considerations for BTCY:  


Modest share structure  
Plenty of cash on hand  
Triple digit revenue growth  
Shares are 25% off recent high  
Strong products in development  
Cardiac Med Tech is a massive market  


BTCY is experiencing triple digit revenue growth and we expect their revenue numbers could grow even faster with the introduction of Biokit. The advancement to home diagnostic monitoring for cardiac patients is likely to grow given the better, faster data it provides to caregivers and the savings offered to the healthcare system.  


BTCY is creating a seamless, wireless data recording system for cardiac patients that may reduce the number of office visits. Many office visits have the function of just collecting this data that BTCY is making available to your doctor wirelessly and perhaps requiring an office visit only when there is an anomaly in your data. Every patient currently using Bioflux is a candidate for Biokit.  


BTCY is creating new verticals to contribute to further growth both in revenues and value. Today the company’s focus is the cardiac sector, but we believe their technology could lead them into the diabetic, sleep apnea, and other sectors as well. The current price looks like an opportunity.

Good day everyone,  


We are continuing coverage on **Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCY),** a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company.  


Current price $3.12/share (at 2:15 PM EDT 9-23-21)  


BTCY is expanding its presentation of its product line, including the new Biokit product. Biokit is a wirelessly connected personal medical device kit that was developed to address the challenges with existing home-based medical devices. The kit, which complements the Bioflux cardiac-diagnostic offering, addresses the $18.4 billion-dollar North American portable medical device market.  


The company CEO presented its products yesterday at the Oppenheimer Fall Healthcare Life Sciences &amp; MedTech Summit.  


Our considerations for BTCY:  


Modest share structure  
Plenty of cash on hand  
Triple digit revenue growth  
Shares are 25% off recent high  
Strong products in development  
Cardiac Med Tech is a massive market  


BTCY is experiencing triple digit revenue growth and we expect their revenue numbers could grow even faster with the introduction of Biokit. The advancement to home diagnostic monitoring for cardiac patients is likely to grow given the better, faster data it provides to caregivers and the savings offered to the healthcare system.  


BTCY is creating a seamless, wireless data recording system for cardiac patients that may reduce the number of office visits. Many office visits have the function of just collecting this data that BTCY is making available to your doctor wirelessly and perhaps requiring an office visit only when there is an anomaly in your data. Every patient currently using Bioflux is a candidate for Biokit.  


BTCY is creating new verticals to contribute to further growth both in revenues and value. Today the company’s focus is the cardiac sector, but we believe their technology could lead them into the diabetic, sleep apnea, and other sectors as well. The current price looks like an opportunity.

Good day everyone,  


We are continuing coverage on **Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCY),** a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company.  


Current price $3.12/share (at 2:15 PM EDT 9-23-21)  


BTCY is expanding its presentation of its product line, including the new Biokit product. Biokit is a wirelessly connected personal medical device kit that was developed to address the challenges with existing home-based medical devices. The kit, which complements the Bioflux cardiac-diagnostic offering, addresses the $18.4 billion-dollar North American portable medical device market.  


The company CEO presented its products yesterday at the Oppenheimer Fall Healthcare Life Sciences &amp; MedTech Summit.  


Our considerations for BTCY:  


Modest share structure  
Plenty of cash on hand  
Triple digit revenue growth  
Shares are 25% off recent high  
Strong products in development  
Cardiac Med Tech is a massive market  


BTCY is experiencing triple digit revenue growth and we expect their revenue numbers could grow even faster with the introduction of Biokit. The advancement to home diagnostic monitoring for cardiac patients is likely to grow given the better, faster data it provides to caregivers and the savings offered to the healthcare system.  


BTCY is creating a seamless, wireless data recording system for cardiac patients that may reduce the number of office visits. Many office visits have the function of just collecting this data that BTCY is making available to your doctor wirelessly and perhaps requiring an office visit only when there is an anomaly in your data. Every patient currently using Bioflux is a candidate for Biokit.  


BTCY is creating new verticals to contribute to further growth both in revenues and value. Today the company’s focus is the cardiac sector, but we believe their technology could lead them into the diabetic, sleep apnea, and other sectors as well. The current price looks like an opportunity.

Trust me, when that crayon marking gets broken with volume and is supported by call options, I can see this squeezing really hard. We are on the cusp of breaking out or breaking down again..

849,849,2880,2880,2880,prtrge,2021-09-20,Order_Flimsy,Could Bumble Help You Retire A Millionaire?,"Bumble (BMBL) has been a volatile investment since its IPO. The female-oriented dating app maker went public at $43 per share in February, and its stock opened at $76 before hitting $84.60 less than a week after its debut.

Bumble's stock tumbled back below its IPO price in May, but it subsequently rebounded to the high $50s after it posted a strong second-quarter report in August. Could Bumble still help you retire a millionaire over the long term? Let's take a fresh look at the bull and bear cases to find out.

What the bulls will say about Bumble
Bumble owns two apps. Its namesake app, which hosts more paying users and generates most of its revenue, only allows women to make the first move. Its older app, Badoo, is more similar to Tinder and generally more popular in Europe and Latin America.

The bulls believe Bumble can carve out a high-growth niche against Match Group (MTCH), which owns Tinder, Hinge, OK Cupid, and other popular dating apps. Bumble's share of the U.S. dating app market rose from 10% in 2017 to 19% in 2020, according to Sensor Tower, putting it firmly in second place behind Tinder's 40% share.

Bumble's number of paid users across both apps rose 20% year-over-year to 2.9 million last quarter. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 13% at Bumble and 4% at Badoo. Bumble expects its total revenue to rise 29% to 31% this year, while analysts expect Match's revenue to grow 26%.

Those growth rates indicate there's plenty of room for Bumble's female-friendly platform to grow. Over the long term, Bumble plans to expand into new overseas markets like India, as well as monetize its BFF feature for platonic friendships and Bizz feature for business connections.

Bumble ended last quarter with $252 million in cash and equivalents and $642 million in total debt. That gives it a fairly low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

Bumble could also benefit from a recent court ruling against Apple that will allow companies to integrate their own in-app payment systems to bypass Apple's 15% to 30% cut of App Store fees.

The global online dating market could grow at a CAGR of 8.44% between 2021 and 2025, according to Statista Research. If Bumble merely matches the market's growth rate, it could generate $1.05 billion in annual revenue in 2025.

But Bumble is growing faster than Match and the broader market, and that trend could continue as it gains more users, launches new premium tiers, expands its international business (which generated 43% of its revenue in the first half of 2021), and monetizes BFF and Bizz as non-dating social networks. Bumble could also acquire smaller dating apps to diversify its portfolio and widen its moat against Match.

Bumble's market cap of $10.7 billion is less than a fourth of Match's market cap of $45.5 billion. Bumble trades at 14 times this year's sales, while Match has a comparable price-to-sales ratio of 15. Therefore, Bumble's higher growth rates and lower valuations could give it more room to run than Match.",1,"['bumble', 'help', 'retire', 'millionaire']

The bulls believe Bumble can carve out a high-growth niche against Match Group (MTCH), which owns Tinder, Hinge, OK Cupid, and other popular dating apps. Bumble's share of the U.S. dating app market rose from 10% in 2017 to 19% in 2020, according to Sensor Tower, putting it firmly in second place behind Tinder's 40% share.

Bumble's number of paid users across both apps rose 20% year-over-year to 2.9 million last quarter. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 13% at Bumble and 4% at Badoo. Bumble expects its total revenue to rise 29% to 31% this year, while analysts expect Match's revenue to grow 26%.

Those growth rates indicate there's plenty of room for Bumble's female-friendly platform to grow. Over the long term, Bumble plans to expand into new overseas markets like India, as well as monetize its BFF feature for platonic friendships and Bizz feature for business connections.

Bumble ended last quarter with $252 million in cash and equivalents and $642 million in total debt. That gives it a fairly low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

Bumble could also benefit from a recent court ruling against Apple that will allow companies to integrate their own in-app payment systems to bypass Apple's 15% to 30% cut of App Store fees.

The global online dating market could grow at a CAGR of 8.44% between 2021 and 2025, according to Statista Research. If Bumble merely matches the market's growth rate, it could generate $1.05 billion in annual revenue in 2025.

But Bumble is growing faster than Match and the broader market, and that trend could continue as it gains more users, launches new premium tiers, expands its international business (which generated 43% of its revenue in the first half of 2021), and monetizes BFF and Bizz as non-dating social networks. Bumble could also acquire smaller dating apps to diversify its portfolio and widen its moat against Match.

Bumble's market cap of $10.7 billion is less than a fourth of Match's market cap of $45.5 billion. Bumble trades at 14 times this year's sales, while Match has a comparable price-to-sales ratio of 15. Therefore, Bumble's higher growth rates and lower valuations could give it more room to run than Match.",1,"['bumble', 'help', 'retire', 'millionaire']

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

[Again showing that CTB spikes showing a massive increase in FTD. Share price significantly lags FTD](https://preview.redd.it/9j5nkel08go71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a572e17a213387d358132b69c8d0505814c7e3a6)

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting.

As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction.

Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

Graphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

&amp;#x200B;

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

[Again showing that CTB spikes showing a massive increase in FTD. Share price significantly lags FTD](https://preview.redd.it/9j5nkel08go71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a572e17a213387d358132b69c8d0505814c7e3a6)

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down.

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

2. Is there a catalyst?

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE.

I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Below are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

$AMC is a bit different because after it spiked to $20+ lot of people jumped out due to FUD, Potential dilution, Chinese convertible shares, but when you take a look at Iborrowdesk now, CTB spiked again causing the shorts to ""cover"" sending it to $69+

&amp;#x200B;

Also the ~~larger than normal~~ bo·da·cious [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious\_(bull)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)) volume we saw over the past week was held down. Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but ""normal"".

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

**""Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales""**

What I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.

**$SDC Catalysts**

So hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.

Now for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.

1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, ""Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.""
2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.
3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.

Before I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.

**""{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. ""**

By making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.

a.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.

b.) ""Please fly again."" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.

c.) ""It only will go to x."" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.

With this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.

**""Putting two and two together""**

As we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\_dehedging\_the\_tiny\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)

The user alluded that, ""*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\*\*"".\*\*

I shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.

**""The Recipe""**

1. High short interest.
2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  

   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, ""It has high short interest bro. Trust me.""
   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.
3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)
4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure
5. Increase Share Price

I know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \~50% SI of free float per Ortex.

This is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.

1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.
2. Is there a catalyst?  

   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.
3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.
4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.
5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.

Now to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.

Announces Expansion of Solar Lithium Project in Nevada. - 0.11/0.088,"Jim Nelson, President of Cruz states, “We are pleased to announce the significant expansion in the size of our Solar Lithium Project in Nevada directly bordering American Lithium Corp.’s TLC project. American Lithium has also recently increased the size of their land position (announced on Sept. 8, 2021) in the direction of Cruz’s Solar Lithium Project, within this exciting lithium district. We strongly believe that battery metals will continue to garner significant market attention as the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to increase along with the explosive growth of the electric vehicle industry. Cruz currently has more than enough cash on hand to fund all of the planned 2021 drill programs and management is looking forward to commencing a fall drill program on the ‘Solar Lithium Project’ as soon as possible. Cruz’s other lithium project is located close by, in Clayton Valley, Nevada, representing one of the few companies that have access to the deepest parts of the only lithium brine basin in production in North America. We are about to come into a major news flow cycle and management remains confident that 2021 will be a trans-formative year for the Company as Cruz has multiple strategically located, and ethically sourced, lithium and cobalt projects in North America. We are working diligently to increase shareholder value and we are optimistic about the company’s growth potential for the remainder of 2021 and beyond”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The strategically-located TLC claystones project is located in one of the world’s most under developed lithium sedimentary basins, near the town of Tonopah in Nevada. Notably, it is in the same geological environment as Albemarle’s world-class Silver Peak lithium mine and several advanced-stage lithium projects.**  (As described on the American Lithium Website.)

&amp;#x200B;

Today's news expands their project from 3200 acres to approximately 5500 acres. This gives the company two highly prospective projects for Lithium in Nevada in addition to several cobalt projects in Canada and  Idaho. First project in Nevada for Lithium is the Clayton Valley  Lithium project which is located in the deep brine near Pure Energy and Albemarle. Pure Energy is currently working with Schlumberger to build out an extraction plant and DLE refinery on their project bordering Cruz's Brine project. Both Schlumberger and Albemarle have invested significant funds over the last year in developing an improving the lithium processing in the valley. Albemarle has been the only producer of lithium from brine in North America for the last 60 years so they are a front runner in the area. The second project which is both significant in size and location is the new Solar claims. While knowing what is in the ground at this time is impossible to know, the fact that American Lithium expanded their TLC property North to the now boundary of the Solar claims has me quite positive on the prospects for the company going forward.

Jim Nelson, President of Cruz states, “We are pleased to announce the significant expansion in the size of our Solar Lithium Project in Nevada directly bordering American Lithium Corp.’s TLC project. American Lithium has also recently increased the size of their land position (announced on Sept. 8, 2021) in the direction of Cruz’s Solar Lithium Project, within this exciting lithium district.

My first post on CRUZ was roughly a year ago when it was trading less than half of what it is now. I make no predictions on where these will go from here but it sure looks interesting to me. I have  200,000 shares currently. Considering the price difference between American Lithium and Cruz at this time I may need to increase my position. I am treating this as a short term trade for now.

Announces Expansion of Solar Lithium Project in Nevada. - 0.11/0.088,"Jim Nelson, President of Cruz states, “We are pleased to announce the significant expansion in the size of our Solar Lithium Project in Nevada directly bordering American Lithium Corp.’s TLC project. American Lithium has also recently increased the size of their land position (announced on Sept. 8, 2021) in the direction of Cruz’s Solar Lithium Project, within this exciting lithium district. We strongly believe that battery metals will continue to garner significant market attention as the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to increase along with the explosive growth of the electric vehicle industry. Cruz currently has more than enough cash on hand to fund all of the planned 2021 drill programs and management is looking forward to commencing a fall drill program on the ‘Solar Lithium Project’ as soon as possible. Cruz’s other lithium project is located close by, in Clayton Valley, Nevada, representing one of the few companies that have access to the deepest parts of the only lithium brine basin in production in North America. We are about to come into a major news flow cycle and management remains confident that 2021 will be a trans-formative year for the Company as Cruz has multiple strategically located, and ethically sourced, lithium and cobalt projects in North America. We are working diligently to increase shareholder value and we are optimistic about the company’s growth potential for the remainder of 2021 and beyond”

&gt;**The strategically-located TLC claystones project is located in one of the world’s most under developed lithium sedimentary basins, near the town of Tonopah in Nevada. Notably, it is in the same geological environment as Albemarle’s world-class Silver Peak lithium mine and several advanced-stage lithium projects.**  (As described on the American Lithium Website.)

Today's news expands their project from 3200 acres to approximately 5500 acres. This gives the company two highly prospective projects for Lithium in Nevada in addition to several cobalt projects in Canada and  Idaho. First project in Nevada for Lithium is the Clayton Valley  Lithium project which is located in the deep brine near Pure Energy and Albemarle. Pure Energy is currently working with Schlumberger to build out an extraction plant and DLE refinery on their project bordering Cruz's Brine project. Both Schlumberger and Albemarle have invested significant funds over the last year in developing an improving the lithium processing in the valley. Albemarle has been the only producer of lithium from brine in North America for the last 60 years so they are a front runner in the area. The second project which is both significant in size and location is the new Solar claims. While knowing what is in the ground at this time is impossible to know, the fact that American Lithium expanded their TLC property North to the now boundary of the Solar claims has me quite positive on the prospects for the company going forward.

Announces Expansion of Solar Lithium Project in Nevada. - 0.11/0.088,"Jim Nelson, President of Cruz states, “We are pleased to announce the significant expansion in the size of our Solar Lithium Project in Nevada directly bordering American Lithium Corp.’s TLC project. American Lithium has also recently increased the size of their land position (announced on Sept. 8, 2021) in the direction of Cruz’s Solar Lithium Project, within this exciting lithium district. We strongly believe that battery metals will continue to garner significant market attention as the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to increase along with the explosive growth of the electric vehicle industry. Cruz currently has more than enough cash on hand to fund all of the planned 2021 drill programs and management is looking forward to commencing a fall drill program on the ‘Solar Lithium Project’ as soon as possible. Cruz’s other lithium project is located close by, in Clayton Valley, Nevada, representing one of the few companies that have access to the deepest parts of the only lithium brine basin in production in North America.

&gt;**The strategically-located TLC claystones project is located in one of the world’s most under developed lithium sedimentary basins, near the town of Tonopah in Nevada.

Today's news expands their project from 3200 acres to approximately 5500 acres. This gives the company two highly prospective projects for Lithium in Nevada in addition to several cobalt projects in Canada and  Idaho. First project in Nevada for Lithium is the Clayton Valley  Lithium project which is located in the deep brine near Pure Energy and Albemarle. Pure Energy is currently working with Schlumberger to build out an extraction plant and DLE refinery on their project bordering Cruz's Brine project. Both Schlumberger and Albemarle have invested significant funds over the last year in developing an improving the lithium processing in the valley. Albemarle has been the only producer of lithium from brine in North America for the last 60 years so they are a front runner in the area. The second project which is both significant in size and location is the new Solar claims. While knowing what is in the ground at this time is impossible to know, the fact that American Lithium expanded their TLC property North to the now boundary of the Solar claims has me quite positive on the prospects for the company going forward.

Today's news expands their project from 3200 acres to approximately 5500 acres. This gives the company two highly prospective projects for Lithium in Nevada in addition to several cobalt projects in Canada and  Idaho. First project in Nevada for Lithium is the Clayton Valley  Lithium project which is located in the deep brine near Pure Energy and Albemarle. Pure Energy is currently working with Schlumberger to build out an extraction plant and DLE refinery on their project bordering Cruz's Brine project. Both Schlumberger and Albemarle have invested significant funds over the last year in developing an improving the lithium processing in the valley. Albemarle has been the only producer of lithium from brine in North America for the last 60 years so they are a front runner in the area. The second project which is both significant in size and location is the new Solar claims. While knowing what is in the ground at this time is impossible to know, the fact that American Lithium expanded their TLC property North to the now boundary of the Solar claims has me quite positive on the prospects for the company going forward.

Announces Expansion of Solar Lithium Project in Nevada. - 0.11/0.088,"Jim Nelson, President of Cruz states, “We are pleased to announce the significant expansion in the size of our Solar Lithium Project in Nevada directly bordering American Lithium Corp.’s TLC project. American Lithium has also recently increased the size of their land position (announced on Sept. 8, 2021) in the direction of Cruz’s Solar Lithium Project, within this exciting lithium district. We strongly believe that battery metals will continue to garner significant market attention as the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to increase along with the explosive growth of the electric vehicle industry. Cruz currently has more than enough cash on hand to fund all of the planned 2021 drill programs and management is looking forward to commencing a fall drill program on the ‘Solar Lithium Project’ as soon as possible. Cruz’s other lithium project is located close by, in Clayton Valley, Nevada, representing one of the few companies that have access to the deepest parts of the only lithium brine basin in production in North America. We are about to come into a major news flow cycle and management remains confident that 2021 will be a trans-formative year for the Company as Cruz has multiple strategically located, and ethically sourced, lithium and cobalt projects in North America. We are working diligently to increase shareholder value and we are optimistic about the company’s growth potential for the remainder of 2021 and beyond”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The strategically-located TLC claystones project is located in one of the world’s most under developed lithium sedimentary basins, near the town of Tonopah in Nevada. Notably, it is in the same geological environment as Albemarle’s world-class Silver Peak lithium mine and several advanced-stage lithium projects.**  (As described on the American Lithium Website.)

Today's news expands their project from 3200 acres to approximately 5500 acres. This gives the company two highly prospective projects for Lithium in Nevada in addition to several cobalt projects in Canada and  Idaho. First project in Nevada for Lithium is the Clayton Valley  Lithium project which is located in the deep brine near Pure Energy and Albemarle. Pure Energy is currently working with Schlumberger to build out an extraction plant and DLE refinery on their project bordering Cruz's Brine project. Both Schlumberger and Albemarle have invested significant funds over the last year in developing an improving the lithium processing in the valley. Albemarle has been the only producer of lithium from brine in North America for the last 60 years so they are a front runner in the area. The second project which is both significant in size and location is the new Solar claims. While knowing what is in the ground at this time is impossible to know, the fact that American Lithium expanded their TLC property North to the now boundary of the Solar claims has me quite positive on the prospects for the company going forward.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

IV FU\*\*ED ME AS HARD AS SHE COULD, AND THE BEST THING IS THAN I SETTED UP MYSELF AT 90° (perfect water temperature for boil your pasta) BUT NOT FOR TAKE AN HYPERLOOP IN YOUR A. HOLE.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

Hour 3:28 pm CEST

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

I opened IB app, and it was up by 400$.

I was polishing my scepter as shiny as i could, i was ready to take my juicy profit.

2 days ago, Wednesday the 8th, was the day before of my last uni exam.

While i was studying as a little bastard, swallowed by my paranoia, i had the brilliant idea to enter in a trade…

I saw GME earning as an opportunity to make dollars… But i said to myself: “You don’t know nothing about finance, don’t bet just on 1 side!” (This was a good point btw)

I have decided to play a straddle @ 195, having a look to option profit calculator to know the probability of success.

I saw a little loss zone between 194$ and 199$ and i was scary to the possible scenario where the price would stay stiff as Rocco Siffredi’s bird 🐦.

As the man who reinvent the wheel i have decided to sell a @ 250 call, receiving premium and be covered on that loss zone just trading off some eventual profit.

All this business for the cost of 3013$ (I know you’re thinking “some pennies”, but that’s not little money for a little Italian stallion).

All right at this point i was standing in front of this chart with green square all over the website, and i said to myself: ""What could go wrong? Nothing isn't it?""

I was like “OMG you’re killing the finance industry with your pennies, you finally found the glitch to stamp money!!!”.

At this point you have to know that i’m really in finance world, i’m studying, learning as many info as i can using whatever way possible, all right??

I finally find the courage to enter in the trade at 8:17 pm CEST, around 1 hour later it was up by 200$ (that’s not bad money for me).

Now was the moment to take the decision, be happy with this 200$ in 1 hour or play the day after… In the most important stadium of the country, as you’re in the finals and Lebron is passing you the ball for the buzzer beater!

The greedy kicks in! You want to be the protagonist of this movie! You want to be the man who brings home the ring!!! 💍

I’m in my car driving, i swap the seat with my (after this) ex-girlfriend, ready to collect as many money as i can, foaming at the mouths, with my eyes falling out!!

This doesn't seem to make any sense 

Dividend yields are similar (Paid out 330 DKK)

A stock has a voting right (there by adding to the value)

B stock has an advantage when it comes to liquidity with an average volume 5x the A stocks

B stock also has an advantage in case of bankruptcy but this should not be an issue with a company of this size.

 This should be adding to the value of the B stock but this can't be the explanation of the big gap.

But after many months I now have 50 shares of AMC and 9000 in dog money (Also a small amount of GME and other coins) it took a while but feeling pretty good about finally reaching my goal with AMC. That's as much as I'm willing to put down for now on AMC. 1000 in doggie fiat to go before I got my 10,000 coins. After that I'm just gonna sit on that and put my money into other plays.

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment.

As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. 

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA’s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market’s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBA’s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn’t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know it’s cheap? Why is the stock a “buy”? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreens’ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA’s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming year’s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA’s progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it’s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called “Haven”) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",1,"['safe', 'sell', 'discount', 'improving', 'target', 'upside']

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone’s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons we’re bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a “virtuous cycle”, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger.

It has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.

The time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.

**Catalysts:**

These are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.

1. Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential. Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.

2. Tesla's Problem Getting It Up  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.

3. Reconciliation Bill Passage  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.

4. Berlin / Austin Gigafactories  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.

**What this means:**

An absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.

WS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.

This thing looks primed for another breakout.

**What can go wrong?**

If the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.

Very little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.

**Conclusion:**

I believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.

For this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative. I also snagged a couple extremely cheap $900/$950 call debit spreads 11/19.

I think all the signs are there that Tesla is finally ready to make an upward move once again. You can hop on the train with me if you want, or you can encourage me to copulate with myself, either way is fine with me.",1,"['turn', 'meme', 'king']

It has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.

The time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.

**Catalysts:**

These are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.

1. Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26.

Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.

2. Tesla's Problem Getting It Up  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.

3. Reconciliation Bill Passage  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.

4. Berlin / Austin Gigafactories  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.

**What this means:**

An absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.

WS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.

This thing looks primed for another breakout.

**What can go wrong?**

If the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.

Very little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.

**Conclusion:**

I believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.

For this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative. I also snagged a couple extremely cheap $900/$950 call debit spreads 11/19.

I think all the signs are there that Tesla is finally ready to make an upward move once again. You can hop on the train with me if you want, or you can encourage me to copulate with myself, either way is fine with me.",1,"['turn', 'meme', 'king']

That's why I went big on LVS and WYNN stock recently.  Both stocks declined about 30% from July to mid August. The primary reason being that they have casinos in Macau (China) that are locked down. 

But for a different reason, I love both these companies. Most casinos don’t actually own their physical property. They sold off their properties to REITs and now lease them back.  However, both WYNN and LVS own their buildings and could sell at any time to raise billions of dollars. When your market cap is only $11B total (WYNN), a $4B cash infusion makes a big difference. I don’t think most investors notice this when comparing PE Ratios between (for instance) WYNN and MGM (which does not own their properties). 
Currently, LVS is $43 per share and WYNN is $100.  

Analysts believe they are worth $64 and $122 per share respectively.  When China reopens, I feel strongly that these stocks will retrace at least half their losses and, at minimum, jump to $50 and $116.  Both would represent a 16% increase from their current prices.",1,"['easily', 'upside']

It has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.

The time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.

**Catalysts:**

These are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.

1. Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential.

It has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.

The time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.

**Catalysts:**

These are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.

1. Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential. Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.

2. Tesla's Problem Getting It Up  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.

3. Reconciliation Bill Passage  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.

4. Berlin / Austin Gigafactories  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.

**What this means:**

An absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.

WS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.

This thing looks primed for another breakout.

**What can go wrong?**

If the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.

Very little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.

**Conclusion:**

I believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.

For this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative. I also snagged a couple extremely cheap $900/$950 call debit spreads 11/19.

Yea, CLOV is a meme-stock.  It is hyped up a lot.  I jumped all-in from Ape-ing out on their hyper-growth numbers (140%) with high SI (15%).  As I learn more about their Clover Assistant Software the happier I get.

It's a SaaS.  They have [developer docs](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/developers) on it.  Filed 2 patents: 1) ""Models for utilizing siloed data"" and 2) ""Clustering data regarding health care providers"".   Integrating Thyme's cancer management software into Clover Assistant.  ValueH licensed to use Clover Assistant in Florida.  From Clover's Reddit AMA, they stated:

1. "" through the Clover Assistant we have the capability to scale like software to superpower all physicians with great tools.""
2. ""Do you see the Clover Assistant being utilized outside of Medicare or the USA in the future? Meaning, is there potential for it to be software as a service?""  
🚀🚀🚀 Andrew: ""Absolutely"". 🚀🚀🚀    

I see a Healthcare Management Cloud Software which integrates more than just billing and record management.  From their patents and recently Thyme cancer smart system integration, this SaaS platform is an open framework where all kinds of healthcare specialty Big Data/AI smart systems can integrate into super powering the physicians.  Look at their patents, they have worked on how to integrate siloed data systems so IP is protected while the results feed into Clover Assistant.  The benefits from this healthcare cloud bigdata framework is enormous.   I can't wait for their presentation at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Health care Conference on Thursday, Sep 9 at 3:20pm.   

If this is a SaaS maybe Clover will eventually have that type of evaluation.  When I look at HUBS, UPST , SNOW, MNDY, ... I get jacked about the potential.

Yea, CLOV is a meme-stock.  It is hyped up a lot.  I jumped all-in from Ape-ing out on their hyper-growth numbers (140%) with high SI (15%).  As I learn more about their Clover Assistant Software the happier I get.

It's a SaaS.  They have [developer docs](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/developers) on it.  Filed 2 patents: 1) ""Models for utilizing siloed data"" and 2) ""Clustering data regarding health care providers"".   Integrating Thyme's cancer management software into Clover Assistant.  ValueH licensed to use Clover Assistant in Florida.  From Clover's Reddit AMA, they stated:

1. "" through the Clover Assistant we have the capability to scale like software to superpower all physicians with great tools.""
2. ""Do you see the Clover Assistant being utilized outside of Medicare or the USA in the future? Meaning, is there potential for it to be software as a service?""  
🚀🚀🚀 Andrew: ""Absolutely"". 🚀🚀🚀    

I see a Healthcare Management Cloud Software which integrates more than just billing and record management.  From their patents and recently Thyme cancer smart system integration, this SaaS platform is an open framework where all kinds of healthcare specialty Big Data/AI smart systems can integrate into super powering the physicians.  Look at their patents, they have worked on how to integrate siloed data systems so IP is protected while the results feed into Clover Assistant.  The benefits from this healthcare cloud bigdata framework is enormous.   I can't wait for their presentation at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Health care Conference on Thursday, Sep 9 at 3:20pm.   

If this is a SaaS maybe Clover will eventually have that type of evaluation.  When I look at HUBS, UPST , SNOW, MNDY, ... I get jacked about the potential.

Yea, CLOV is a meme-stock.  It is hyped up a lot.  I jumped all-in from Ape-ing out on their hyper-growth numbers (140%) with high SI (15%).  As I learn more about their Clover Assistant Software the happier I get.

It's a SaaS.  They have [developer docs](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/developers) on it.  Filed 2 patents: 1) ""Models for utilizing siloed data"" and 2) ""Clustering data regarding health care providers"".   Integrating Thyme's cancer management software into Clover Assistant.  ValueH licensed to use Clover Assistant in Florida.  From Clover's Reddit AMA, they stated:

1. "" through the Clover Assistant we have the capability to scale like software to superpower all physicians with great tools.""
2. ""Do you see the Clover Assistant being utilized outside of Medicare or the USA in the future? Meaning, is there potential for it to be software as a service?""  
🚀🚀🚀 Andrew: ""Absolutely"". 🚀🚀🚀    

I see a Healthcare Management Cloud Software which integrates more than just billing and record management.  From their patents and recently Thyme cancer smart system integration, this SaaS platform is an open framework where all kinds of healthcare specialty Big Data/AI smart systems can integrate into super powering the physicians.  Look at their patents, they have worked on how to integrate siloed data systems so IP is protected while the results feed into Clover Assistant.  The benefits from this healthcare cloud bigdata framework is enormous.   I can't wait for their presentation at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Health care Conference on Thursday, Sep 9 at 3:20pm.   

If this is a SaaS maybe Clover will eventually have that type of evaluation.  When I look at HUBS, UPST , SNOW, MNDY, ... I get jacked about the potential.

Yea, CLOV is a meme-stock.  It is hyped up a lot.  I jumped all-in from Ape-ing out on their hyper-growth numbers (140%) with high SI (15%).  As I learn more about their Clover Assistant Software the happier I get.

It's a SaaS.  They have [developer docs](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/developers) on it.  Filed 2 patents: 1) ""Models for utilizing siloed data"" and 2) ""Clustering data regarding health care providers"".   Integrating Thyme's cancer management software into Clover Assistant.  ValueH licensed to use Clover Assistant in Florida.  From Clover's Reddit AMA, they stated:

1. "" through the Clover Assistant we have the capability to scale like software to superpower all physicians with great tools.""
2. ""Do you see the Clover Assistant being utilized outside of Medicare or the USA in the future? Meaning, is there potential for it to be software as a service?""  
🚀🚀🚀 Andrew: ""Absolutely"". 🚀🚀🚀    

I see a Healthcare Management Cloud Software which integrates more than just billing and record management.  From their patents and recently Thyme cancer smart system integration, this SaaS platform is an open framework where all kinds of healthcare specialty Big Data/AI smart systems can integrate into super powering the physicians.  Look at their patents, they have worked on how to integrate siloed data systems so IP is protected while the results feed into Clover Assistant.  The benefits from this healthcare cloud bigdata framework is enormous.   I can't wait for their presentation at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Health care Conference on Thursday, Sep 9 at 3:20pm.   

If this is a SaaS maybe Clover will eventually have that type of evaluation.  When I look at HUBS, UPST , SNOW, MNDY, ... I get jacked about the potential.

**$ATOS**  
One word: Endoxifen. For those that might not be aware, Endoxifen is a breast cancer drug created by Atossa Therapeutics. The recent phase 1 clinical trial data surpassed expectations. The result from phase 2 (just been authorized by the Swedish regulator) might see the stock go parabolic, if the clinical trial data continues to show the same degree of efficacy.  


**$BBIG**  
I'm very bullish on their recent acquisition, Lomotif (A short-form video platform with 225 million app installs and over 30 million monthly active users worldwide). Lomotif is expanding into India, which is fertile ground to plant a viral user acquisition campaign that will generate millions of new users (TikTok is banned in India). Watch this stock potentially double in 12-18 months.  


**$BNCHF**  
One of the biggest gold-silver drill projects in Canada (The Lawyers Project). Like all junior mining plays, the trick is to find companies with good early-on mineralization data. On that Benchmark has struck gold. The recent drill test lab results on the Lawyers project have all been exceptional. I see this company being acquired by the likes of Newmont or Barrick in a year or two.

@ Mods: Market Cap of Ticker is $1.14b

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got ~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

https://preview.redd.it/kak6phy0vzk71.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738ab4508c91af5280dc8255017c54f5cd8e8f76

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Edit #2:

I'm now fairly confident the incentive shares are subject to the lockup, so until registration of the PIPE shares, we're looking at 2.5M float plus whatever has been gifted to charity. Warrants can't convert for another 30 days, so those are also not a threat at the moment.""",1,"['security', 'gamma', 'squeeze']

One word: Endoxifen. For those that might not be aware, Endoxifen is a breast cancer drug created by Atossa Therapeutics. The recent phase 1 clinical trial data surpassed expectations.

**$BBIG**  
I'm very bullish on their recent acquisition, Lomotif (A short-form video platform with 225 million app installs and over 30 million monthly active users worldwide). Lomotif is expanding into India, which is fertile ground to plant a viral user acquisition campaign that will generate millions of new users (TikTok is banned in India).

**$ATOS**  
One word: Endoxifen. For those that might not be aware, Endoxifen is a breast cancer drug created by Atossa Therapeutics. The recent phase 1 clinical trial data surpassed expectations. The result from phase 2 (just been authorized by the Swedish regulator) might see the stock go parabolic, if the clinical trial data continues to show the same degree of efficacy.  


**$BBIG**  
I'm very bullish on their recent acquisition, Lomotif (A short-form video platform with 225 million app installs and over 30 million monthly active users worldwide). Lomotif is expanding into India, which is fertile ground to plant a viral user acquisition campaign that will generate millions of new users (TikTok is banned in India). Watch this stock potentially double in 12-18 months.  


**$BNCHF**  
One of the biggest gold-silver drill projects in Canada (The Lawyers Project). Like all junior mining plays, the trick is to find companies with good early-on mineralization data. On that Benchmark has struck gold. The recent drill test lab results on the Lawyers project have all been exceptional. I see this company being acquired by the likes of Newmont or Barrick in a year or two.

**$ATOS**  
One word: Endoxifen. For those that might not be aware, Endoxifen is a breast cancer drug created by Atossa Therapeutics. The recent phase 1 clinical trial data surpassed expectations. The result from phase 2 (just been authorized by the Swedish regulator) might see the stock go parabolic, if the clinical trial data continues to show the same degree of efficacy.  


**$BBIG**  
I'm very bullish on their recent acquisition, Lomotif (A short-form video platform with 225 million app installs and over 30 million monthly active users worldwide). Lomotif is expanding into India, which is fertile ground to plant a viral user acquisition campaign that will generate millions of new users (TikTok is banned in India). Watch this stock potentially double in 12-18 months.  


**$BNCHF**  
One of the biggest gold-silver drill projects in Canada (The Lawyers Project). Like all junior mining plays, the trick is to find companies with good early-on mineralization data. On that Benchmark has struck gold. The recent drill test lab results on the Lawyers project have all been exceptional. I see this company being acquired by the likes of Newmont or Barrick in a year or two.

2539,2539,8427,8427,8427,pfslld,2021-09-01,WhatsFoodG,Code Green: COIN Breakout Imminent!,"Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \*cue picture\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up

&amp;#x200B;

[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)

Now i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. 

&amp;#x200B;

 However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. 

&amp;#x200B;

 However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. 

&amp;#x200B;

 However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.

Now i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. 

&amp;#x200B;

 However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.

I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.

This is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.

Now i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally.
